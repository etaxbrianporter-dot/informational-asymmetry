**1. Definition**

The construction begins with a combinatorial observation: certain
complete graphs, when embedded on their minimal orientable surfaces,
produce integer matrices whose spectral theory simultaneously encodes
geometric, arithmetic, and algebraic information. We formalize the
object that carries all this information.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition 1.1 (Spectral Motive)**                                  |
|                                                                       |
| A spectral motive is a quadruple M = (G, Σ, σ, Γ) where:              |
|                                                                       |
| \(i\) G = K₂ₙ is a complete graph on 2n vertices (n ≥ 2)              |
|                                                                       |
| \(ii\) Σ is the minimal orientable surface on which K₂ₙ₋₁ admits a    |
|                                                                       |
| triangulation, i.e., (2n−4)(2n−5)/12 ∈ ℤ, and Σ has genus             |
|                                                                       |
| g = (2n−4)(2n−5)/12                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| \(iii\) σ is the cyclic symmetry group ℤ₂ₙ₋₁ inherited from the       |
|                                                                       |
| rotational symmetry of the triangulation of K₂ₙ₋₁ on Σ                |
|                                                                       |
| \(iv\) Γ is the Gram matrix of the (2n−1)!! perfect matchings of G,   |
|                                                                       |
| with entries Γᵢⱼ = Oᵢⱼ · ω\^(ζᵢ − ζⱼ) where Oᵢⱼ is the                |
|                                                                       |
| overlap (twice the number of shared edges) and ω = e\^(2πi/3)         |
|                                                                       |
| encodes the direction structure from the surface embedding            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The existence condition---that K₂ₙ₋₁ triangulates a surface---is
restrictive. The triangulation sequence begins:

  ----------- ----------- --------- --------------- -------------------------------
  **K₂ₙ₋₁**   **Genus**   **K₂ₙ**   **Matchings**   **Status**

  K₃          0           K₄        3               Trivial (GR on S²)

  K₇          1           K₈        105             Computed (this paper)

  K₁₅         11          K₁₆       2,027,025       Next instance (intractable)

  K₁₉         20          K₂₀       654,729,075     Beyond current methods
  ----------- ----------- --------- --------------- -------------------------------

The sparseness of this sequence is fundamental: the spectral motive is
not defined for arbitrary complete graphs, only for those admitting the
triangulation--symmetry--embedding chain. The physically realized
sectors (K₄ for gravity, K₈ for Yukawa) occupy the first two non-trivial
positions.

**2. Sector Decomposition**

The cyclic symmetry σ = ℤ₂ₙ₋₁ decomposes the Gram matrix into sectors.
For M(K₈), the decomposition proceeds as follows.

**2.1 The global overlap structure**

Before imposing any embedding, the 105×105 overlap matrix of K₈
matchings has exactly three eigenvalues. This is a general phenomenon:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Proposition 2.1 (Three-eigenvalue property)**                       |
|                                                                       |
| For K₂ₙ with n ≥ 3, the overlap matrix O has exactly three distinct   |
|                                                                       |
| eigenvalues:                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| λₘₐₓ = 2n · (2n−3)!! (multiplicity 1, trivial S₂ₙ rep)                |
|                                                                       |
| λₘᵢᵈ = specific value (multiplicity = dim S₂ₙ irrep (2n−2, 2))        |
|                                                                       |
| λ = 0 (all remaining irreps)                                          |
|                                                                       |
| For K₈: λₘₐₓ = 120 (×1), λₘᵢᵈ = 36 (×20), λ = 0 (×84)                 |
|                                                                       |
| For K₁₀: λₘₐₓ = 1050 (×1), λₘᵢᵈ = 240 (×35), λ = 0 (×909)             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The middle eigenspace, of dimension equal to the S₂ₙ irrep (2n−2, 2), is
the "physical" eigenspace. The vacuum structure lives entirely within
its projection onto the σ-sectors.

**2.2 The ℤ₇ sector structure of K₈**

The cyclic group ℤ₇, inherited from the Heawood map of K₇ on T², acts on
the 105 matchings of K₈ by rotating vertices 1 through 7 while fixing
vertex 0. Each orbit has size 7, giving 15 orbits. At each ℤ₇ irrep ρₖ
(k = 0, \..., 6), the Gram matrix restricts to a 15×15 sub-matrix with:

> • One null eigenvector (from the structure of hub matchings)
>
> • One companion eigenvector with eigenvalue 24
>
> • Six vacuum eigenvectors, roots of the irreducible sextic f(x)

The active sub-Gram is therefore 14×14, with integer entries in {0, 2,
4, 8}, trace 112, and characteristic polynomial:

det(xI − Gₛᵤᵇ) = x · (x − 24) · f(x)²

where the vacuum sextic is:

f(x) = x⁶ − 44x⁵ + 720x⁴ − 5648x³ + 22512x² − 43456x + 31808

This polynomial is irreducible over ℚ. Its six roots are the vacuum
eigenvalues, ranging from λₘᵢₙ = 1.960 to λₘₐₓ = 17.800.

**3. The Five Realizations**

The spectral motive M(K₈) admits five distinct realizations, each
extracting different mathematical content from the same underlying
structure. We exhibit them in turn, with emphasis on how each
independently constrains the same invariants.

**3.1 Spectral Realization**

The spectral realization is the characteristic polynomial f(x) and the
eigenvalue structure of the sector sub-Gram. Its primary data:

  ---------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------------------
  **Eigenvalue**   **Numerical     **Multiplicity**   **Role**
                   value**                            

  λ₀ = 0           0               1                  Null direction

  λ_c = 24         24              1                  Companion (uniform mode)

  λ₁, \..., λ₆     1.960 \...      2 (each)           Vacuum sector (roots of f)
                   17.800                             
  ---------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------------------

The companion eigenvalue 24 = Tr(Gₛᵤᵇ) − 2×(sum of sextic roots) = 112 −
88 plays a critical role: it is the interface between the physical
(vacuum) and non-physical (uniform) modes of the sub-Gram.

**3.2 Arithmetic Realization**

The discriminant of f(x) encodes the arithmetic content:

Δ(f) = 2³⁶ × 7⁴ × 43 × 421²

Each discriminant prime marks a specific modular eigenvalue
collision---a prime p at which two spectrally distinct eigenspaces of
the sub-Gram become indistinguishable over 𝔽ₚ:

  --------- ---------------- ------------------------ --------------------
  **Prime   **Double root    **Structural meaning**   **Exponent**
  p**       mod p**                                   

  2         x ≡ 0            Overlap parity (all      36
                             entries even)            

  7         x ≡ 4            ℤ₇ symmetry order        4

  43        x ≡ 24           Companion--vacuum        1 (odd)
            (companion λ)    collision                

  421       x ≡ −14 (−dim)   Dimensional collision    2 (even)
  --------- ---------------- ------------------------ --------------------

The parity of the exponent has Galois-theoretic consequences: 43
appearing to odd power forces Gal(f) ⊄ A₆, while 421 appearing to even
power has no such effect. The square-free part of Δ(f) is therefore 43
alone.

**3.3 Algebraic Realization**

The splitting field of f(x) over ℚ has degree 6, with Galois group:

Gal(f/ℚ) ≅ C₂ ≀ C₃ ≅ (C₂)³ ⋊ C₃, \|Gal\| = 24

The subfield lattice:

ℚ ⊂ ℚ(√43) ⊂ ℚ(λ)

with \[ℚ(√43):ℚ\] = 2 and \[ℚ(λ):ℚ(√43)\] = 3. The quadratic subfield
ℚ(√43) is forced by the odd exponent of 43 in the discriminant. The
cubic extension over it reflects the three-generation structure of the
vacuum (three conjugate pairs of ℤ₇ irreps, each 2-dimensional over ℝ).

This splitting field is linearly disjoint from the K₆ splitting field
ℚ(√5), confirming that the K₆ (Higgs) and K₈ (Yukawa) sectors carry
independent algebraic content.

**3.4 Evaluative Realization**

The evaluation map f : ℤ → ℤ probes the relationship between structural
integers and discriminant primes. At each structural integer α (an
integer with geometric or algebraic meaning in the K₈ framework), the
value f(α) and its GCD with f′(α) reveal discriminant primes:

  ------- ---------------- ---------------- --------------- -------------------
  **α**   **Structural     **f(α)**         **gcd(f(α),     **Primes
          meaning**                         f′(α))**        recovered**

  0       Zero overlap     2⁶ × 7 × 71      2⁶ × 7          {2, 7}

  7       \|ℤ₇\| symmetry  7 × 43           7               {7}
          order                                             

  24      Companion        2⁶ × 7 × 43 ×    2⁶ × 7 × 43     {2, 7, 43}
          eigenvalue       701                              

  −14     −dim(sub-Gram)   2⁶ × 7 × 421²    2⁶ × 7 × 421    {2, 7, 421}
  ------- ---------------- ---------------- --------------- -------------------

The four structural evaluation points {0, 7, 24, −14} recover all four
discriminant primes {2, 7, 43, 421}. No other integers are needed. The
evaluation map converts geometric data (overlap values, symmetry orders,
eigenvalues, dimensions) directly into arithmetic data (discriminant
primes).

Additionally, the sextic exhibits structural antisymmetry at the
intermediate overlap values:

f(2) = −64 = −f(4), i.e., f(2) + f(4) = 0

The mirror axis x = 3 is the midpoint of the overlap values {2, 4}, and
the identity f(x) + f(6−x) = 2(x−2)(x−4)q(x) for a specific quartic q
shows that the sextic "knows about" the overlap lattice.

**3.5 Combinatorial Realization**

The combinatorial realization captures the representation-theoretic
decomposition of the matching space under the full automorphism group S₈
and its subgroup ℤ₇:

> Global (S₈): The 105-dimensional matching representation decomposes as
> \[8\] ⊕ \[6,2\] ⊕ (kernel), with dimensions 1 + 20 + 84 = 105 and
> eigenvalues 120, 36, 0 respectively.
>
> Local (ℤ₇): The 20-dimensional "physical" eigenspace from S₈ irrep
> \[6,2\] projects non-uniformly into the seven ℤ₇ sectors. Since 20/7
> is not an integer, the sectors carry different amounts of the physical
> eigenspace. This asymmetry is the origin of non-trivial vacuum
> structure.

The combinatorial realization also provides the centered heptagonal
decomposition of the discriminant prime: 43 = 1 + 7 + 14 + 21, where the
layers are the K₈ structural constants (trivial rep, \|ℤ₇\|,
dim(sub-Gram), \|E(K₇)\|).

**4. Convergence Points**

A convergence point of the spectral motive M is an invariant that is
simultaneously determined by all five realizations. These points are
over-determined: any single realization suffices to compute them, but
all five agree. This over-determination is what makes them "physically
real"---they cannot be changed by moving within any single mathematical
framework without breaking consistency with the others.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition 4.1 (Convergence Point)**                                |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| A convergence point of M is a quantity q such that:                   |
|                                                                       |
| \(i\) q is computable from each Rᵢ independently                      |
|                                                                       |
| \(ii\) the value of q is the same in all realizations                 |
|                                                                       |
| \(iii\) perturbing q in any single realization forces a compensating  |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| realization functors applied to M.                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

We identify five convergence points of M(K₈):

**Convergence Point 1: The prime 43**

  ----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  **Realization**   **How 43 appears**

  Spectral          Double root of f(x) at companion eigenvalue 24 modulo 43

  Arithmetic        Square-free part of Δ(f) = 2³⁶ × 7⁴ × 43 × 421²

  Algebraic         Forces Gal ⊄ A₆; splitting field contains ℚ(√43)

  Evaluative        f(7) = 7 × 43; f(24) ≡ 0 mod 43

  Combinatorial     43 = 1 + 7 + 14 + 21 (centered heptagonal on K₈ layers)
  ----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

The prime 43 divides no combinatorial invariant of K₈ (verified:
matching count 105, spanning trees 8⁶, Hamiltonian cycles 2520,
automorphism group 8!, all overlap distribution counts, all
characteristic polynomial coefficients). It emerges purely from the
spectral collision between companion and vacuum eigenspaces. This makes
43 the first "purely emergent" arithmetic invariant of the framework: a
number with no graph-theoretic origin that is nonetheless completely
determined by graph-theoretic data.

That 43 is also a Heegner number (class number h(−43) = 1, giving unique
factorization in the ring of integers of ℚ(√−43)) may reflect a deeper
rigidity: the spectral collision must occur at a prime where the
arithmetic is maximally unambiguous, and Heegner primes are precisely
those where imaginary quadratic arithmetic admits unique factorization.

**Convergence Point 2: The prime 7**

The prime 7 is simultaneously the order of the cyclic symmetry group, a
factor of the matching count (7 \| 105), the number of vertices of K₇ on
the torus, a ramification prime in the splitting field, and the integer
at which the evaluation map produces f(7) = 7 × 43. It is the
"structural prime" of M(K₈), present in every layer of the construction.

**Convergence Point 3: The Higgs mass ratio a₄/a₂² = 0.3722**

This convergence point lives in the K₆ sub-motive, propagated to K₈
through the embedding K₆ ↪ K₇ ↪ K₈. The ratio a₄/a₂² is the spectral
kurtosis of the K₆ Gram matrix vacuum eigenvector, computed as a finite
algebraic expression with zero free parameters. Through the NCG spectral
action formula mₕ²/4M²_W = a₄/(c · a₂²), it determines the Higgs mass.
The K₆ splitting field ℚ(√5) is linearly disjoint from the K₈ splitting
field ℚ(√43), confirming that the Higgs sector and Yukawa sector carry
independent algebraic content.

**Convergence Point 4: The Yukawa hierarchy 415 : 135 : 1**

The 90 non-hub matchings of K₈ assemble into a 3×3 Yukawa matrix Y whose
singular values, in the ρ₁ sector (the unique sector accessible from the
K₆ vacuum), give the hierarchy 415 : 135 : 1. This is determined by: (i)
the vacuum eigenvector components in the spectral realization, (ii) the
ℤ₇ representation structure in the combinatorial realization, (iii) the
K₆ vacuum projection theorem (ρ₂ inaccessibility) in the evaluative
realization.

**Convergence Point 5: The vacuum degeneracy dim Vᵥₐᵘ = 6**

The 6-fold degeneracy of the ground eigenvalue arises from three
conjugate pairs of ℤ₇ irreps (ρ₁, ρ₂, ρ₃), each 2-dimensional over ℝ.
That dim(Vᵥₐᵘ) = 6 = dim(so(4)) = dim(su(2)ₗ × su(2)ᵣ) equals the
dimension of the custodial symmetry algebra of the Standard Model Higgs
sector. The ρ₂ sector's inaccessibility from K₆ provides a geometric
mechanism for neutrino decoupling: one-third of the vacuum degeneracy is
hidden from the Higgs.

**5. Rigidity and Physical Reality**

**5.1 What convergence means**

An ordinary mathematical invariant is "real" in the Platonic sense: it
is a well-defined quantity that follows from axioms. A convergence point
is real in a stronger sense: it is over-determined by independent
mathematical structures. The value 43 can be computed from the Sylvester
resultant of the sextic (spectral), from modular factorization over 𝔽₄₃
(arithmetic), from the discriminant's effect on the Galois group
(algebraic), from polynomial evaluation at the symmetry order
(evaluative), or from the centered heptagonal decomposition of K₈
structural constants (combinatorial). These five computations use
different axiom systems, different definitions, and different proof
techniques. They agree because they are projections of a single object.

The analogy with Grothendieck's theory of motives is deliberate. In that
framework, behind every cohomology theory (de Rham, étale, Betti,
crystalline) lies a universal object---the motive---such that each
cohomology is a "realization." One never sees the motive directly; one
sees its shadows in different mathematical languages, and the shadows
are consistent because they come from the same source. The spectral
motive M(K₈) plays the same role for physical observables: the Higgs
mass, the Yukawa hierarchy, and the discriminant primes are "shadows" of
the Gram matrix in different mathematical languages, and their
consistency is what makes them physical.

**5.2 The role of the surface**

The surface Σ is not a background on which physics takes place. It is
the structural element that creates the cyclic symmetry σ, which creates
the sector decomposition, which creates the vacuum sextic, which creates
the discriminant primes. Without the surface, the 105×105 overlap matrix
has only three eigenvalues and no non-trivial vacuum structure. The
surface breaks the S₈ symmetry to ℤ₇ and thereby converts a
combinatorial object (a matching count) into an arithmetic one (a number
field with Galois group and discriminant).

This is why the triangulation condition matters: it ensures the surface
embedding has maximal symmetry (all faces triangular, cyclic rotation
acts freely on vertices), which produces the cleanest possible sector
decomposition. Non-triangulating embeddings (such as K₁₀ on genus 4,
with three quadrilateral faces) lack canonical cyclic symmetry and do
not produce well-defined spectral motives.

**5.3 The triangulation sequence as selection principle**

The sequence of complete graphs Kₙ that triangulate orientable surfaces
is:

K₃, K₄, K₇, K₁₂, K₁₅, K₁₆, K₁₉, K₂₄, K₂₇, K₂₈, \...

To produce a spectral motive with perfect matchings (hence vacuum
structure), we need Kₙ₊₁ to have an even number of vertices, i.e., n
must be odd. The admissible n values from the triangulation sequence
are:

n = 3 (K₄), n = 7 (K₈), n = 15 (K₁₆), n = 19 (K₂₀), n = 27 (K₂₈), \...

Only K₄ and K₈ are computationally accessible. K₁₆ with its 2,027,025
matchings represents a barrier not of principle but of practice. The
existence of the sequence---and the fact that it selects precisely the
graphs whose spectral motives have physically interpretable convergence
points---suggests that the triangulation condition is not merely a
technical convenience but a structural selection principle determining
which complete graphs carry physical content.

**6. Open Directions**

**6.1 The K₁₂ prediction**

K₁₂ triangulates genus 6, and 11 (= 12 − 1) is prime, suggesting ℤ₁₁
cyclic symmetry. K₁₂ itself has 10,395 matchings but an odd number of
vertices (no spectral motive as defined). However, K₁₂ may carry its own
internal structure analogous to K₇'s role in the K₈ analysis. The
centered 11-gonal number at m = 4 gives C₁₁(4) = 6 × 11 + 1 = 67, which
is another Heegner number. Whether this extends the pattern 43 = 6 × 7 +
1 from K₈ is an open question.

**6.2 Motivic functoriality**

The embedding K₆ ↪ K₇ ↪ K₈ induces maps between spectral motives. The K₆
vacuum projects onto the K₈ vacuum eigenspace with 23.55% weight,
entirely in the ρ₁ component. This projection is a morphism of spectral
motives. A complete functorial theory would describe how spectral
motives compose along graph embeddings, and whether the physical content
(masses, couplings) is functorial in this sense.

**6.3 Heegner numbers and spectral rigidity**

Three of the four K₈ discriminant primes (2, 7, 43) are Heegner numbers.
The Heegner property---class number 1, unique factorization---may
correspond to spectral rigidity: the collision at a Heegner prime is
"irreducible" in the sense that it cannot be decomposed into simpler
collisions. Whether spectral motives systematically produce Heegner
primes as their square-free discriminant parts is testable in principle
(at K₁₆) though not in practice with current methods.

**6.4 Evaluation maps as computational tools**

The discovery that evaluating f(α) at structural integers recovers all
discriminant primes suggests a practical computational strategy: for
larger motives (K₁₆, K₂₀), even if the full discriminant is intractable,
the evaluation map at structural points (0, symmetry order, companion
eigenvalue, −dimension) may reveal discriminant primes directly. This
converts a problem requiring O(d²)-digit arithmetic (computing the
resultant) into one requiring only O(d)-digit arithmetic (evaluating a
polynomial), a potentially decisive reduction in computational
complexity.
