# K₂ₙ Dark Matter Probe: Complete Results

## Original Hypothesis
Higher K₂ₙ levels (K₁₀, K₁₂, ...) produce massive, SM-neutral, gravitationally coupled particles stabilized by topological protection and/or selection rules.

## Status: KILLED — Four Independent Kills

## Computation 1: K₁₀ Mass Scale — COMPUTED

| Level | a₂ | R = a₄/a₂² | Mass (GeV) |
|-------|-----|------------|------------|
| K₆   | 6.98 | 0.993 | 126.1 (calibration) |
| K₈   | 33.2 | 0.999 | 275.7 |
| K₁₀  | 317.8 | 0.99999 | 853.8 |

R → 1 rapidly. Higher levels have increasingly stiff vacua.

## Computation 2: Aperture Decay — KILLS HYPOTHESIS

Cross-level coupling emb(K₈)×vac(K₁₀): rank 21, σ_max = 122.1.

| Channel | Frobenius² | Fraction | g² |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|
| Total | 29,700 | 100% | 1.000 |
| Internal (shared K₈ edges) | 21,600 | 72.7% | 0.727 |
| Aperture (edges involving 8,9) | 3,780 | 12.7% | 0.127 |
| Cross-term | 4,320 | 14.5% | — |

Internal coupling is ORDER ONE. Even with maximal spectral action suppression (m/Λ)⁴, lifetime ≈ 10⁻⁷ s — 24 orders of magnitude short of cosmological stability.

## Path 1: Z₉ Composite Anomaly — KILLED

The Z₃ ⊂ Z₉ subgroup creates a Z₃ grading on K₁₀ matchings (315 per charge, zero fixed points, all size-3 orbits).

**Gift:** Embedded K₈ is 100% coset charge q=1, while every K₁₀ orbit is perfectly democratic (1/3 per charge).

**Kill:** Cross-level overlap does not conserve Z₃ charge. Charge-conserving = 33.3% of Frobenius norm (= random). No selection rule.

**Bonus:** K₁₀ vacuum anomalous multiplicities (1, 2, 4) are all pure q=0. Generic 6-fold states are mixed q=1⊕q=2. Z₃ organizes the composite anomaly spectrum.

## Path 3: CP Mismatch — KILLED

K₈: independent CP (C₂ × C₃, since 2³ ≡ 1 mod 7). K₁₀: derived CP (C₆, since 2³ ≡ -1 mod 9).

1. **Embedding breaks C₂:** C₂(K₁₀) maps emb(K₈) to COMPLETELY DISJOINT set (0/105 overlap). Aperture (8,9) → (0,9).
2. **C₂ doesn't intertwine:** ||commutator||/||O_cross|| = 1.20. CP not conserved across levels.
3. **Derived CP = fewer quantum numbers:** K₈ has more freedom to absorb decay products. Mismatch works AGAINST stability.

## Path 4: Higher-Level Coupling — KILLED (DECISIVE)

| Transition | g²_total | g²_internal | g²_aperture | g²_scalar | int_frac |
|-----------|---------|------------|------------|----------|---------|
| K₆→K₈    | 1.000 | 0.656 | 0.156 | 0.357 | 65.6% |
| K₈→K₁₀   | 1.000 | 0.727 | 0.127 | 0.354 | 72.7% |
| K₁₀→K₁₂  | 1.000 | 0.774 | 0.107 | 0.351 | 77.4% |

**g²_total = 1.000 exactly at every level.** Normalization identity of the matching algebra.

**g²_internal INCREASES:** 0.656 → 0.727 → 0.774. Ratio = 1.086× per step. Internal coupling gets STRONGER at higher levels.

**No level in the K₂ₙ tower will produce stable dark matter.** The coupling is algebraically order one at every level.

## Structural Discoveries

1. **Z₃ coset charge purity of embeddings.** Embedded K₈ is 100% coset q=1 while all K₁₀ orbits are perfectly democratic.

2. **Z₃ organizes K₁₀ anomalies.** Anomalous multiplicities (1, 2, 4) are all pure Z₃ charge q=0. Composite subgroup creates clean anomalous/regular partition.

3. **Maximal CP violation of embeddings.** C₂(K₁₀) maps emb(K₈) to completely disjoint set. Zero matching overlap.

4. **g²_total = 1 normalization identity.** Total cross-level coupling exactly 1 at every level tested. Likely a theorem of the matching algebra.

5. **Internal coupling fraction increases monotonically.** 65.6% → 72.7% → 77.4%. Matching algebra becomes more interconnected at higher levels.

## Surviving Path: Geometric Dark Matter (Path 5)

The framework explains dark energy geometrically (spectral dimension deficit). Dark matter could also be geometric — a modification of gravitational dynamics from the d_eff mechanism, not a particle. The f(ε) ~ 1/ε² scaling modifies effective gravity at intermediate scales. Requires completing the d_eff(ε) campaign and checking against rotation curves, lensing, and CMB data.
