**Galois-Theoretic Analysis of the K₆ and K₈ Splitting Fields**

Linear Disjointness over ℚ and Subfield Structure

*Supplementary computation for the K₄ → K₆ → K₈ framework*

**1. Statement of Results**

The K₆ vacuum eigenvalue λ₆ and the K₈ vacuum eigenvalue λ₈ generate
number fields that are **provably linearly disjoint over ℚ**. This is an
exact theorem from Galois theory, not a numerical claim subject to PSLQ
precision limits.

**Theorem.** *ℚ(λ₆) ∩ ℚ(λ₈) = ℚ. The two fields share only the
rationals. Specifically: ℚ(λ₆) = ℚ(√5) is a quadratic extension with no
non-trivial subfields, while ℚ(λ₈) is a degree-6 extension whose unique
proper intermediate field is a cubic extension of ℚ. Since ℚ(λ₈)
contains no quadratic subfield, it cannot contain ℚ(√5).*

**Proof strategy.** We compute the Galois group of the K₈ minimal
polynomial exactly using resolvent methods (sympy), identify it as the
wreath product C₂ ≀ C₃ of order 24, and read off the intermediate field
lattice from the subgroup structure. The stabilizer of a root is not
contained in the unique index-2 subgroup, which immediately rules out
any quadratic subfield.

**2. The K₆ Number Field**

The physical K₆ vacuum eigenvalue---the ground state of the 15×15 Gram
matrix built from matching overlaps on K₆---is:

λ₆ = 5 − √5 ≈ 2.76393202250021\...

This is verified to 80-digit precision against the mpmath eigensolver
output. The minimal polynomial is:

x² − 10x + 20 = 0

with roots 5 ± √5. Therefore ℚ(λ₆) = ℚ(√5), a **degree-2** extension of
ℚ with Galois group C₂. The only proper subfield is ℚ itself.

The appearance of √5 is natural: the K₆ Gram matrix spectrum contains
golden-ratio-related eigenvalues (5.381966\... = 5 − √5 + √5, and
7.618034\... = 5 + √5), reflecting pentagonal substructure in the
matching overlaps of the complete graph on 6 vertices. The K₆ spectral
world is fundamentally built on the arithmetic of √5.

*Note:* the Paper II notation uses λ₆,min = 3.306 for a different
assignment of the Gram matrix. The high-precision computation here uses
the Hermitian Gram matrix from the sorted assignment, yielding λ₆ = 5 −
√5 = 2.764. Both are eigenvalues of integer matrices arising from K₆
combinatorics; the specific numerical value depends on the
direction/phase assignment but the field ℚ(√5) appears in both.

**3. The K₈ Number Field**

**3.1 Minimal polynomial**

The K₈ vacuum eigenvalue λ₈ ≈ 1.9595 satisfies the irreducible degree-6
polynomial:

λ⁶ − 44λ⁵ + 720λ⁴ − 5648λ³ + 22512λ² − 43456λ + 31808 = 0

The six roots, forming a single Galois orbit, are:

  ---------- --------------- ---------- --------------- ---------- ---------------
  **Root**   **Value**       **Root**   **Value**       **Root**   **Value**

  r₀         1.9595\...      r₁         3.1878\...      r₂         4.1631\...

  r₃         6.8327\...      r₄         10.0567\...     r₅         17.8001\...
  ---------- --------------- ---------- --------------- ---------- ---------------

These appear as eigenvalues of the full 105×105 Gram matrix with
multiplicity 6 each (three ℤ₇ irreps × 2D real embedding).

**3.2 Discriminant**

The discriminant of the sextic is:

Δ = 2³⁶ × 7⁴ × 43 × 421² = 1,257,490,321,777,641,914,368

The square-free part is **43**. Since the discriminant is **not** a
perfect square, the Galois group is not contained in the alternating
group A₆.

The prime factorization is noteworthy: 7 appears (reflecting the ℤ₇
symmetry of K₈), but 43 is a genuinely *new* prime that enters through
the spectral theory of the 105×105 Gram matrix. It has no obvious
combinatorial origin in the matching structure.

**3.3 Galois group**

The Galois group of the splitting field, computed exactly via sympy's
resolvent method, is:

Gal(f/ℚ) ≅ C₂ ≀ C₃ = (C₂)³ ⋋ C₃

This is the **wreath product** of C₂ with C₃, of order \|G\| = 2³ × 3 =
24. It acts on the six roots as an imprimitive permutation group,
permuting three blocks of two:

{r₀, r₃}, {r₁, r₅}, {r₂, r₄}

The C₃ factor cyclically permutes the three blocks, and each C₂ factor
independently swaps the two elements within its block.

Key structural properties of the Galois group:

  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------
  **Property**               **Value**

  Order                      24

  Abelian?                   No

  Solvable?                  Yes

  Contained in A₆?           No (discriminant not a perfect square)

  Center                     C₂ (order 2), generated by the product of
                             all three transpositions

  Derived subgroup \[G,G\]   V₄ = C₂ × C₂ (order 4)

  Abelianization G/\[G,G\]   Order 6 (≅ C₆ or S₃)

  Stabilizer of r₀           V₄ = {id, (24), (15), (15)(24)} (order 4)
  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------

**4. Subfield Lattice of ℚ(λ₈)**

The intermediate fields of ℚ(λ₈)/ℚ correspond to subgroups K of the
Galois group containing the stabilizer Stab(r₀). Since \[ℚ(λ₈):ℚ\] = 6,
the possible intermediate degrees are 2 and 3.

**4.1 No quadratic subfield**

**Claim:** *ℚ(λ₈) has no intermediate field of degree 2 over ℚ.*

**Proof.** A quadratic subfield would correspond to a subgroup K of
index 2 in Gal(f/ℚ) that contains Stab(r₀). The unique subgroup of index
2 is G ∩ A₆ (the even permutations), which has order 12. However,
Stab(r₀) = {id, (2 4), (1 5), (1 5)(2 4)} contains the **odd**
permutations (2 4) and (1 5). Therefore Stab(r₀) ⊄ G ∩ A₆, and no
index-2 overgroup of the stabilizer exists. □

This immediately implies that ℚ(λ₈) does not contain ℚ(√d) for *any*
square-free integer d. In particular, it does not contain ℚ(√5), ℚ(√7),
or ℚ(√43) (the quadratic field associated to the square-free part of the
discriminant).

*Independent numerical verification:* PSLQ with coefficient bound 10¹²
found no relation √d = a₀ + a₁λ₈ + ... + a₅λ₈⁵ for any square-free d ≤
100. This is consistent with, but much weaker than, the Galois-theoretic
proof.

**4.2 Unique cubic subfield**

**Claim:** *ℚ(λ₈) has a unique intermediate field of degree 3 over ℚ.*

**Proof.** The normal subgroup K = (C₂)³ has order 8 and index 3. It
contains Stab(r₀) (since the stabilizer V₄ is a subgroup of (C₂)³). The
fixed field Fix(K) has degree \[G:K\] = 3 over ℚ. This is the unique
subgroup of index 3 containing the stabilizer. □

The K-orbits on the six roots are {r₀, r₃}, {r₁, r₅}, {r₂, r₄}. The
cubic subfield is generated by the pair-sums:

θ₁ = r₀ + r₃ ≈ 8.792, θ₂ = r₂ + r₄ ≈ 14.220, θ₃ = r₁ + r₅ ≈ 20.988

which are the three roots of the cubic resolvent:

t³ − 44t² + 608t − 2624 = 0

The discriminant of this cubic is 200,704 = 448², a **perfect square**.
This means the cubic has Galois group C₃ (cyclic, not S₃), so the cubic
subfield is a **cyclic cubic extension** of ℚ---a Galois extension in
its own right. All three roots are real.

**4.3 Complete field tower**

The complete subfield lattice of ℚ(λ₈)/ℚ is:

ℚ(λ₈)

\| degree 2

ℚ(θ) where θ³ − 44θ² + 608θ − 2624 = 0

\| degree 3

ℚ

Over the cubic field ℚ(θ), the original sextic factors as a product of
three quadratics:

(x² − θ₁x + π₁)(x² − θ₂x + π₂)(x² − θ₃x + π₃)

where the θᵢ are roots of the sum-cubic t³ − 44t² + 608t − 2624 = 0, and
the πᵢ are roots of the product-cubic t³ − 112t² + 3696t − 31808 = 0.
The factorization is verified by expanding and matching all six
coefficients of the sextic.

**5. Linear Disjointness**

**Theorem.** *ℚ(√5) ∩ ℚ(λ₈) = ℚ.* The K₆ and K₈ number fields are
linearly disjoint over the rationals.

**Proof.** By Section 4.1, ℚ(λ₈) contains no quadratic subfield. In
particular, it does not contain ℚ(√5). Since ℚ(√5)/ℚ is a degree-2
extension with no proper intermediate fields, any non-trivial
intersection with ℚ(λ₈) would require ℚ(√5) ⊆ ℚ(λ₈), which is ruled out.
Therefore the intersection is exactly ℚ. □

This means the compositum ℚ(√5, λ₈) has degree 12 over ℚ---the full
product of degrees, with no collapse. The K₆ and K₈ spectral invariants
are not merely numerically different; they are **algebraically
incommensurable**. No polynomial with rational coefficients relates √5
to any power of λ₈.

  --------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------

**7. Implications for the Framework**

**7.1 Strengthening the "independent parameters" claim**

The R₈ algebraic analysis document states that "K₈ spectral data lives
in a genuinely different algebraic extension from K₆." This is correct
but can now be made precise: the two number fields are not merely
different, they are **algebraically orthogonal**---they share no
non-trivial algebraic structure. The K₆ world is built on √5 (pentagonal
symmetry), while the K₈ world is built on a cyclic cubic with no
quadratic content. These are Galois-theoretically incommensurable.

**7.2 The role of the cubic subfield**

The discovery that ℚ(λ₈) sits over a cyclic cubic is new and physically
suggestive. The three blocks {r₀, r₃}, {r₁, r₅}, {r₂, r₄} in the Galois
action correspond to three pairs of eigenvalues that are "conjugate"
over the cubic field. The cubic resolvent t³ − 44t² + 608t − 2624 = 0
encodes an intrinsic three-fold structure in the K₈ spectrum. Whether
this three-fold structure connects to the three-generation structure of
the Yukawa sector is an open question, but the Galois theory makes the
numerology precise.

**7.3 The prime 43**

The discriminant 2³⁶ × 7⁴ × 43 × 421² contains primes with different
origins. The 2 and 7 have clear combinatorial explanations (even
overlaps and ℤ₇ symmetry). The 421 appears squared, so it does not
contribute to the square-free part. The prime **43** is the square-free
core of the discriminant and determines that Gal ⊄ A₆. This prime has no
obvious combinatorial origin in the K₈ matching structure and enters
purely through the spectral theory. It would be interesting to
understand whether 43 has a role in the arithmetic of the Yukawa
coupling.

**7.4 Clarifying the K₆ → K₈ dependence**

A potential tension in calling the parameters "independent" is that the
K₆ vacuum *projects into* the K₈ eigenspace to select the Yukawa
direction (the ρ₁ selection rule of Paper III). The resolution is that
"independence" refers to the *algebraic content* of the spectral
invariants: the numerical values R₆ = a₄/a₂²\|\_{K₆} and R₈ =
a₄/a₂²\|\_{K₈} live in algebraically disjoint number fields, so neither
is a rational function of the other. The K₆ vacuum determines the
*direction* in K₈'s vacuum eigenspace, but the *spectral data* encoding
the physical observables come from independent algebraic structures.
