Surviving Invariants of the Informational Asymmetry Program (v11)

Final Synthesis: From Three Axioms to the Edge of Gravity

Revision Note

This is **v2** of the computation requirements document. It incorporates
six structural changes relative to v1:

-   **Phase 0 (sign diagnostic)** added as a mandatory gate before
    GPU-scale computation.

-   **Parallel methods** (Majorana decomposition, conformal bootstrap,
    iDMRG) planned alongside DQMC, not as fallbacks.

-   **Lattice operator construction** for spin-2 and spin-3 required
    explicitly before Computation 2.

-   **Resource budget** revised upward to 4,000--6,000 GPU-hours with
    autocorrelation accounting.

-   **First-order transition diagnostics** added (energy histograms,
    Binder cumulant).

-   **U**~c~ error propagation protocol added for Computation 2.

Sections marked \[NEW\] or \[REVISED\] indicate material not present in
v1.

1\. Context and Purpose

1.1 What Has Been Proved

Three informational axioms (quadratic closure, first-order, D ≠ D\*)
uniquely force a 2+1 Dirac operator on the K₄ lattice with V₄ = Z₂×Z₂
matching algebra and Chern number C = −2. This is formalized across
eleven invariants in the companion document
(surviving_invariants_v11.docx).

A fourth axiom (observer finitude) produces effective dimension d_eff =
3 for finite subsystem observers, with verified Fisher metric isotropy
(g_EE/g_kk = 0.985), verified first law of entanglement (δS/δS_pred =
1.0004), and verified Bisognano--Wichmann locality (R² = 1.000). These
close three of four steps in the gap from 2+1 to 3+1 Einstein gravity.

1.2 What This Computation Determines

The free K₄ Dirac model is holographically dual to Vasiliev higher-spin
gravity in AdS₄ (Klebanov--Polyakov 2002, Giombi--Yin 2010). This is a
theory with infinitely many massless higher-spin fields: spin-1, spin-2,
spin-3, spin-4, and so on. Our universe has only spin-2 (gravity) plus
lower-spin matter. The higher-spin fields must acquire large masses (and
hence large anomalous dimensions in the boundary CFT) to decouple.

This requires the boundary theory to be at a strongly interacting
quantum critical point. The computation determines: (a) whether such a
critical point exists for the K₄ lattice model, and (b) whether the
operator spectrum at that critical point has a large gap above spin-2,
signaling higher-spin decoupling.

1.3 Outcome Map

  ------------- ------------------------- --------------------------------

Any of these outcomes is a clean result. The framework does not require
γ₃ \> 2 to be valuable---it has already derived emergent 3+1 geometry
from informational axioms. The question is whether the geometry has the
right field content.

2\. The Model

2.1 Lattice Geometry

Triangular lattice with lattice vectors a₁ = (1, 0) and a₂ = (−1/2,
√3/2). Each site carries 4 orbitals corresponding to the 4 vertices of
K₄ (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4). The Bravais lattice is triangular with one site
per unit cell. Total sites: N = L×L on a torus (periodic boundary
conditions in both directions).

2.2 Non-Interacting Hamiltonian

The single-particle hopping Hamiltonian in momentum space is the 4×4
matrix:

***D(k) = e*{ik·δ₁} M₁ + ω e{ik·δ₂} M₂ + ω² e{ik·δ₃} M₃**

where ω = e\^{2πi/3} is the Z₃ flux, the displacement vectors are δ₁ =
(1,0), δ₂ = (−1/2, √3/2), δ₃ = −δ₁ − δ₂, and the matching matrices are:

-   **M₁:** permutation (12)(34), with 1s at positions (1,2), (2,1),
    (3,4), (4,3) and 0s elsewhere.

-   **M₂:** permutation (13)(24), with 1s at positions (1,3), (3,1),
    (2,4), (4,2) and 0s elsewhere.

-   **M₃:** permutation (14)(23), with 1s at positions (1,4), (4,1),
    (2,3), (3,2) and 0s elsewhere.

The many-body Hamiltonian at the non-interacting level is H₀ = ∑\_k
c†(k) H(k) c(k), where H(k) is the 8×8 chiral Hamiltonian \[\[0, D(k)\],
\[D†(k), 0\]\] and c(k) is an 8-component fermion operator (4 orbitals ×
2 sublattice/chiral components). The ground state at half-filling
occupies the 4 negative-energy bands.

2.3 Interaction

The V₄-invariant on-site Hubbard interaction:

***H_int = U ∑\_i ∑\_{α\<β} n\_{i,α} n\_{i,β}***

where i runs over lattice sites, α and β run over the 4 orbitals (K₄
vertices), and n\_{i,α} = c†\_{i,α} c\_{i,α} is the number operator.
This is the density--density interaction between all pairs of orbitals
at the same site. It is the most general on-site interaction invariant
under V₄ (which permutes the 4 orbitals via the three matchings).

Equivalently, H_int = (U/2) ∑\_i (N_i − 2)² − const, where N_i = ∑\_α
n\_{i,α}. At half-filling (average 2 particles per site out of 4
orbitals), this is particle-hole symmetric.

**Full Hamiltonian: H = H₀ + H_int**

2.4 Symmetries

The model has the following symmetries that must be preserved by the
computation:

-   **V₄ orbital symmetry:** The three matchings M₁, M₂, M₃ generate V₄
    = Z₂×Z₂ acting on the 4 orbitals. All matchings commute. The
    interaction is invariant under all three.

-   **Particle-hole symmetry:** At half-filling with the interaction
    written as (U/2)(N_i − 2)², the Hamiltonian is invariant under c ↔
    c†. This ensures the chemical potential is exactly μ = 0.

-   **Translational symmetry:** Periodic boundary conditions on the L×L
    torus.

-   **Z₃ flux structure:** The phases ω, ω² in D(k) break time-reversal
    but preserve a Z₃ rotational symmetry of the triangular lattice.

3\. Phase 0: Sign Problem Diagnostic \[NEW\]

3.1 Why This Must Come First

The standard DQMC sign-freedom guarantee (det(M) ≥ 0 at half-filling
with particle-hole symmetry) relies on time-reversal symmetry on a
bipartite lattice. The K₄ model violates both conditions: the Z₃ flux
explicitly breaks time-reversal (proved in surviving_invariants_v11,
Section 5.2), and the triangular lattice is not bipartite. The 4-orbital
V₄ structure may restore an effective sign-freedom through an enlarged
symmetry (analogous to how SU(2) models on non-bipartite lattices can be
sign-free via Majorana decomposition), but this is not guaranteed and
must be established before committing GPU resources.

3.2 Analytical Check: Majorana Decomposition

Before any simulation, check whether the K₄ model admits a sign-free
Majorana representation:

-   The V₄ = Z₂ × Z₂ structure provides three involutions on the
    4-orbital space. Each Z₂ generator pairs two orbitals. Determine
    whether these pairings can be used to define Majorana modes such
    that the resulting fermion determinant factors into a product of
    real, non-negative pieces.

-   Reference framework: Li, Jiang, Yao (2015) solved the sign problem
    for SU(2) models on non-bipartite lattices using Majorana
    decomposition. The V₄ structure is suggestive of a similar approach.

-   If the Majorana decomposition succeeds, DQMC is sign-free for all U,
    and Phase 0 is resolved analytically. Proceed directly to
    Computation 1.

3.3 Empirical Diagnostic

If the analytical check is inconclusive, run small-scale DQMC to measure
the average sign:

  ---------------- ---------------- ---------------- --------------------

3.4 Go/No-Go Criteria

**GREEN (⟨sign⟩ \> 0.3 for all L and U):** Proceed with DQMC for
Computations 1 and 2. The sign problem is manageable.

**YELLOW (0.1 \< ⟨sign⟩ \< 0.3 at target L):** DQMC is possible but
expensive. Double the measurement sweep budget. Consider supplementing
with alternative methods (Section 6).

**RED (⟨sign⟩ \< 0.1 for L ≥ 12):** DQMC is impractical for this model.
Switch primary method to one of the alternatives in Section 6. Do not
proceed to Computation 1 via DQMC.

**Key diagnostic:** Plot log⟨sign⟩ vs L at fixed U. If the slope is
steep and negative, the sign problem is exponential in system size and
DQMC is fundamentally blocked, not just expensive.

4\. Computation 1: Locate the Quantum Critical Point

4.1 Objective

Determine the critical coupling U_c at which the system transitions from
a Dirac semimetal (gapless, with Dirac cones at K and K′ points) to a
gapped insulating phase. This is the semimetal-to-insulator quantum
phase transition.

4.2 Method: Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo

Use projective (zero-temperature) or finite-temperature determinantal
QMC (DQMC). The model has 4 orbitals per site. The interaction is a sum
of density--density terms, each of which can be decoupled via a discrete
Hubbard--Stratonovich (HS) transformation.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 0 must return GREEN or YELLOW before proceeding.

4.3 Observables

-   **Single-particle gap Δ(U):** Extracted from the imaginary-time
    Green's function G(τ) = ⟨c(τ) c†(0)⟩ at the K-point. At large τ:
    G(τ) \~ e\^{−Δτ}. Plot Δ(U) vs U. The critical point U_c is where Δ
    → 0.

-   **Antiferromagnetic order parameter:** m² = (1/N²) ∑\_{i,j}
    (−1)\^{i+j} ⟨S_i · S_j⟩, generalized to 4-orbital SU(4) generators.
    Non-zero m² in the thermodynamic limit signals the insulating phase.

-   **Density--density correlation at 2k_F:** To distinguish
    antiferromagnetic from charge-density-wave order.

-   **Quasiparticle residue Z(U):** From the momentum-distribution
    discontinuity at the Fermi surface. Z → 0 signals breakdown of the
    quasiparticle picture.

-   **\[NEW\] Energy histogram P(E):** At each U near the expected
    transition, record the full energy distribution. A double-peaked
    distribution that sharpens with increasing L signals a first-order
    transition.

-   **\[NEW\] Binder cumulant U₄:** U₄ = 1 − ⟨m⁴⟩/(3⟨m²⟩²). A negative
    dip in U₄ as a function of U, sharpening with L, signals
    first-order. Crossing of U₄ curves for different L at a single point
    signals second-order and gives U_c.

-   **\[NEW\] Average sign ⟨sign⟩:** Record at every (U, L) point as
    ongoing diagnostic. If ⟨sign⟩ degrades below 0.1 at target sizes,
    reassess.

  ------------------ --------------------- -------------------------------

4.5 Finite-Size Scaling

At the critical point, the gap scales as Δ(L) \~ L\^{−z} where z is the
dynamic critical exponent (z = 1 for Dirac fermions, possibly different
at the interacting fixed point). Perform data collapse of Δ(U, L) × L\^z
vs (U − U_c) × L\^{1/ν} to extract U_c, z, and ν simultaneously.

4.6 Transition Order Diagnostic \[NEW\]

Before proceeding to Computation 2, determine the order of the
transition:

-   **Second-order (continuous):** Binder cumulant curves for different
    L cross at a single U_c. Gap closes as a power law. Proceed to
    Computation 2 at U_c.

-   **Weakly first-order:** Energy histogram shows a shallow double
    peak; Binder cumulant has a mild negative dip. The system may have a
    walking regime with an approximate CFT. Proceed with caution;
    anomalous dimensions are approximate.

-   **Strongly first-order:** Energy histogram shows deep double peak
    sharpening with L; Binder cumulant has a strong negative dip. No CFT
    exists at the transition. Holographic argument does not apply
    directly. Consider whether intermediate phases exist between U = 0
    and the first-order jump.

-   **No transition found for U ≤ 8:** Extend U range. If no transition
    exists, Axiom 5 has no realization in this model.

4.7 Expected Outcome

Based on analogous models (SU(4) Hubbard on honeycomb, N-flavor Dirac on
triangular), U_c is expected to be in the range 2--6 in units of the
hopping amplitude t = 1. The transition is expected to be continuous
(second-order) into an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator, though a
first-order transition or an intermediate spin-liquid phase are
possible.

\(f\) \[NEW\] Energy histograms P(E) at three U values near U_c for L =
12, 18, 24.

\(g\) \[NEW\] Integrated autocorrelation times for gap and order
parameter at U_c.

5\. Computation 2: Operator Spectrum at the Critical Point

5.1 Objective

At U = U_c (from Computation 1), measure the scaling dimensions of
operators in each spin sector. The critical quantity is the higher-spin
gap: the difference between the scaling dimension of the lowest spin-3
operator and the spin-2 stress tensor.

5.2 Why This Matters

In the holographic dual, a boundary operator of spin s and scaling
dimension Δ corresponds to a bulk field of spin s and mass m² L²_AdS =
Δ(Δ − d) where d = 3 is the boundary spacetime dimension. The stress
tensor (s = 2) has Δ = 3 (protected by the Ward identity). If the spin-3
operator has Δ = 3 + γ with γ large, the corresponding bulk field has
mass \~ γ/L_AdS and decouples at low energies. γ ≫ 1 means the bulk is
effectively Einstein gravity. γ = 0 means the bulk is Vasiliev
higher-spin gravity.

5.3 Lattice Operator Construction \[NEW\]

**This section must be completed before Computation 2 begins.**

The continuum spin-s operators must be realized as lattice operators in
irreducible representations of the triangular lattice point group (C₆v).
Incorrect lattice constructions can mix spin sectors, corrupting the
measurement.

5.3.1 Spin-0 (Scalar)

O₀(x) = c†\_α(x) c_α(x) − 2 (particle density deviation from
half-filling). This is straightforward---it transforms as the trivial
representation of C₆v.

5.3.2 Spin-1 (Current)

J_μ(x) = c†\_α(x) γ_μ c_α(x) (conserved current). Δ = 2, protected by
current conservation. Measure as a consistency check.

5.3.3 Spin-2 (Stress Tensor)

On the lattice, the stress tensor is constructed from the
nearest-neighbor bond energy operator. The traceless symmetric tensor
representation of C₆v decomposes into specific irreps. The
energy--energy correlator ⟨T₀₀(x,τ) T₀₀(0,0)⟩ is a proxy but mixes with
scalar operators unless the trace subtraction is performed using the
lattice symmetry. Explicit construction following Assaad and Herbut
(2013): define the bond operator B_δ(x) = c†(x) D_δ c(x + δ) + h.c. for
each nearest-neighbor direction δ, then form the traceless combination
using C₆v Clebsch--Gordan coefficients. Confirm Δ_T = 3 as a consistency
check.

5.3.4 Spin-3 (THE CRITICAL OBSERVABLE)

**This is the measurement that determines the outcome of the program.**

The lowest spin-3 operator involves second-neighbor finite-difference
operators (lattice analogues of ∂\_ν ∂\_ρ). On the triangular lattice
with C₆v symmetry, the spin-3 representation corresponds to the totally
symmetric traceless rank-3 tensor. This requires:

-   Constructing second-neighbor hopping expectation values along all
    lattice directions.

-   Symmetrizing over all C₆v-related directions.

-   Subtracting all traces (contractions with δ\_{μν}) to isolate the
    spin-3 component from spin-1 contamination.

-   Explicit reference: Otsuka, Yunoki, and Sorella (2016) for
    higher-spin lattice operators on triangular Dirac systems.

At the free Dirac fixed point: Δ₃ = 4 (canonical dimension for a
twist-2, spin-3 operator in d = 3). At the interacting critical point:
Δ₃ = 4 + γ₃.

5.3.5 Spin-4 (Secondary)

Constructed analogously with third-neighbor finite differences. Measure
γ₄. If γ₄ \> γ₃, the tower of higher-spin anomalous dimensions is
growing, which is the expected pattern for Einstein gravity duals.

5.4 The Higher-Spin Gap

**The higher-spin gap is γ₃ = Δ₃ − 4.** This is the single number that
determines the outcome.

**γ₃ \> 2:** Strong decoupling. The bulk is effectively Einstein
gravity. The five-axiom framework succeeds.

**0.5 \< γ₃ \< 2:** Partial decoupling. The bulk has massive but
non-negligible higher-spin fields.

**γ₃ \< 0.5:** No meaningful decoupling. The bulk is Vasiliev-like.

5.5 Extraction Method

For each operator O\^{(s)}, measure the imaginary-time correlator at
fixed momentum k = 0: C_s(τ) \~ τ\^{−2Δ_s} for a CFT. This is generally
cleaner in QMC than the equal-time spatial correlator. Alternatively,
use the equal-time correlation function C_s(r) = ⟨O\^{(s)}(r)
O\^{(s)}(0)⟩ and extract Δ_s by fitting log C_s vs log r at intermediate
distances (larger than lattice spacing, smaller than L/2).

For finite-size scaling: at the critical point on a torus of size L,
C_s(r) = L\^{−2Δ_s} f_s(r/L) where f_s is a universal scaling function.
Compute C_s(r) at fixed r/L across multiple system sizes and fit the
L-dependence.

5.6 U_c Error Propagation \[NEW\]

Computation 2 runs at U = U_c from Computation 1, but U_c has error bars
δU. Near a critical point, anomalous dimensions vary rapidly with
coupling. To control this:

-   **Run at three couplings:** U_c − δU, U_c, and U_c + δU.

-   **Compare γ₃:** If γ₃ varies by less than its own statistical error
    across these three values, the result is robust. If it varies by
    more, refine U_c with additional Computation 1 runs at finer U
    spacing near the transition.

-   **Report:** Quote final γ₃ with both statistical error (from QMC
    sampling) and systematic error (from U_c uncertainty).

\(d\) γ₄ if available, to check whether the anomalous dimension tower is
growing.

\(e\) \[NEW\] Sensitivity analysis: γ₃ at U_c ± δU.

6\. Alternative and Parallel Methods \[NEW\]

These methods should be scoped in parallel with DQMC, not treated as
afterthoughts. If Phase 0 returns RED, one of these becomes the primary
method.

6.1 Majorana Decomposition QMC

**When to use:** If the analytical check (Section 3.2) yields a valid
Majorana representation.

The V₄ = Z₂ × Z₂ structure on 4 orbitals provides three involutions,
each of which pairs orbitals (1↔2 and 3↔4 under M₁, etc.). If these
pairings can define Majorana modes such that the HS-decomposed fermion
determinant factors into real, non-negative pieces, the sign problem is
solved for all U. This is an analytical result that, once established,
makes DQMC sign-free by construction. Reference: Li, Jiang, Yao,
"Solving the fermion sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations by
Majorana representation," Phys. Rev. B 91, 241117 (2015).

6.2 Conformal Bootstrap

**When to use:** After Computation 1 determines the symmetry class of
the critical point (assuming continuous transition).

The conformal bootstrap bounds operator dimensions in 2+1 CFTs directly
from crossing symmetry, unitarity, and global symmetry---no Monte Carlo
needed. For the K₄ model at a continuous transition with V₄ global
symmetry, the relevant bootstrap setup is:

-   2+1 dimensions, Z₂ × Z₂ global symmetry, fermionic external
    operators.

-   Target: upper bound on spin-3 operator dimension Δ₃ given that
    spin-2 has Δ = 3.

-   Advantage: provides rigorous bounds, not statistical estimates. Can
    determine whether γ₃ \> 2 is even consistent with unitarity and
    crossing symmetry for this symmetry class.

-   Limitation: requires knowing the symmetry class, which comes from
    Computation 1. Best suited as a parallel check once the phase
    diagram is established.

Key references: Kos, Poland, Simmons-Duffin (2014) for the 3D bootstrap;
Chester et al. (2020) for fermionic bootstrap.

6.3 Tensor Network / iDMRG on Cylinders

**When to use:** As an independent cross-check, or as primary method if
DQMC sign problem is severe.

Infinite DMRG (iDMRG) on infinite cylinders with finite circumference
L_y can access the critical point and extract scaling dimensions from
the entanglement spectrum (Li--Haldane correspondence). For a 2+1 CFT on
a cylinder of circumference L_y, the entanglement spectrum levels are
ξ_i = (2π/L_y) Δ_i.

-   Avoids the sign problem entirely.

-   Limitation: circumferences are limited (typically L_y ≤ 12 for
    4-orbital models), introducing finite-size effects in one direction.

-   For the K₄ model, the 4-orbital structure gives local Hilbert space
    dimension 2⁴ = 16 per site. With bond dimension χ \~ 2000--4000,
    moderate cylinder sizes are accessible.

-   Provides independent cross-validation of U_c and Δ_s from DQMC.

6.4 Exact Diagonalization (Computation 0.5)

**When to use:** Immediately, in parallel with Phase 0. Small-cluster ED
gives the phase diagram topology at zero cost.

Exact diagonalization on L = 3 (9 sites, 36 orbitals) and L = 6 (36
sites, 144 orbitals) tori. L = 3 is trivially exact; L = 6 requires
Lanczos but is feasible. This gives:

-   Ground-state energy E_0(U) and spectral gap for small systems.

-   Qualitative phase diagram: where does the gap open?

-   Order parameter and correlation functions as sanity checks.

-   Sign of the fermion determinant at each (U, auxiliary field
    configuration) for small systems---direct empirical input for Phase
    0.

7\. Software and Implementation

7.1 Recommended Packages

-   **ALF (Algorithms for Lattice Fermions):** Open-source Fortran/MPI
    package for DQMC. Supports multi-orbital Hubbard models on arbitrary
    lattices. Website: alf.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de. The K₄ model can be
    implemented as a 4-orbital model on a triangular lattice.

-   **QUEST (QUantum Electron Simulation Toolbox):** Alternative DQMC
    package. C/Fortran with MPI.

-   **SmoQyDQMC:** Julia-based DQMC with GPU support. May offer the
    fastest path to GPU-accelerated runs for this model.

-   **ITensor / TeNPy:** For iDMRG alternative method (Section 6.3).

-   **SDPB:** For conformal bootstrap (Section 6.2).

For custom implementations, key references: Blankenbecler, Scalapino,
Sugar (1981) for the BSS algorithm; Assaad (2002) for projective QMC;
Loh et al. (1990) for sign problem analysis.

7.2 GPU Acceleration

The bottleneck in DQMC is repeated inversion of (N_sites × N_orb)
matrices. For L = 24: matrix size 2304 × 2304. For L = 36: matrix size
5184 × 5184. GPU-accelerated dense linear algebra (cuBLAS, cuSOLVER)
provides 10--50x speedup over CPU.

**Total estimated budget: 2,200--5,800 A100 GPU-hours** (previously
600--2,500). The increase accounts for autocorrelation time divergence
near U_c, the three-point U_c bracket for error propagation, and the
larger sweep counts needed for reliable spin-3 correlator extraction.

**Autocorrelation accounting:** Near U_c, autocorrelation times diverge
as τ_auto \~ L\^z. At L = 36 with z ≈ 1, effective independent samples
are reduced by a factor of \~36 relative to naive sweep count. The sweep
budgets above already account for this, but the binning analysis is
essential to verify.

**Critical path:** Phase 0 → Computation 1 → Computation 2. Total wall
time on the critical path: 7--21 days assuming GPU availability.

**Parallel work (no GPU needed):** Majorana decomposition analysis
(Phase A), exact diagonalization (Phase 0.5), and lattice operator
construction (Phase B) can all begin immediately and require only a
workstation and analytical effort.

Any of these outcomes is a clean result. The framework does not require
γ₃ \> 2 to be valuable---it has already derived emergent 3+1 geometry
from informational axioms. The question is whether the geometry has the
right field content.
