# CFSG Structure of Spectral Extractors

## The Core Discovery

The Galois group of the vacuum sextic is **not an arithmetic accident**. It is the image of the Heawood map's automorphism group acting on the eigenvalue structure.

### The mechanism

The Heawood map (Kâ‚‡ on the torus) has automorphism group **Zâ‚‡ â‹Š Zâ‚ƒ** of order 21, where:
- Zâ‚‡ = vertex rotations
- Zâ‚ƒ = direction class permutations (generated by d â†’ 2d mod 7)

This group acts on the eigenvalue pairs of the vacuum sextic:
- Zâ‚‡ acts **trivially** (each sector has the same characteristic polynomial)
- Zâ‚ƒ **permutes** the three conjugate eigenvalue pairs cyclically
- Complex conjugation provides Câ‚‚ **within** each pair

Result: **Gal(K/Q) â‰… Câ‚‚ â‰€ Câ‚ƒ**, which is exactly the wreath product structure reflecting:
- Câ‚ƒ from the symmetry contribution (direction permutations)
- Câ‚‚Â³ from the arithmetic contribution (complex conjugation on eigenvalue pairs)

### Verification via PSLâ‚‚(7) branching

PSLâ‚‚(7) (order 168, simple, Lie type Aâ‚) contains Zâ‚‡ as its Sylow 7-subgroup. The 6-dimensional irrep Ï‡â‚† of PSLâ‚‚(7) restricts to Zâ‚‡ as:

    Ï‡â‚† â†“ Zâ‚‡ = Ïâ‚ + Ïâ‚‚ + Ïâ‚ƒ + Ïâ‚„ + Ïâ‚… + Ïâ‚†

This is **exactly** the content of the vacuum eigenspace. The two 3-dimensional irreps split it further:

    Ï‡â‚ƒâ‚ â†“ Zâ‚‡ = Ïâ‚ + Ïâ‚‚ + Ïâ‚„   (quadratic residues mod 7)
    Ï‡â‚ƒáµ¦ â†“ Zâ‚‡ = Ïâ‚ƒ + Ïâ‚… + Ïâ‚†   (quadratic non-residues mod 7)

The Zâ‚ƒ orbits on Zâ‚‡-characters match the Ï‡â‚ƒâ‚/Ï‡â‚ƒáµ¦ decomposition: **the direction class structure IS the quadratic residue structure of Fâ‚‡**.

### The general principle

For any spectral extractor:

    Gal(K/Q) â‰… (arithmetic kernel) â‰€ (symmetry quotient)

- **Arithmetic kernel**: Câ‚‚ factors from complex conjugation on eigenvalue pairs
- **Symmetry quotient**: the image of the map automorphism group acting on conjugacy classes of sectors

The CFSG classifies the possible symmetry quotients.

## CFSG Level Structure

### Level 1: Cyclic (Type I simple groups Z/pZ)
- **Status**: Completed (Kâ‚ˆ prototype)
- **Symmetry quotient**: subgroup of Z_{(p-1)/2}
- **Output Galois**: solvable (wreath products Câ‚‚ â‰€ C_k)
- **Automorphy**: guaranteed (Arthur-Clozel)
- **L-functions**: genuinely NEW (not standard Langlands)

### Level 2: Alternating (Type II: A_n, n â‰¥ 5)
- **Status**: Feasible, not computed
- **Natural objects**: permutations, Steiner systems
- **Symmetry quotient**: A_n-related permutations on sectors
- **Output Galois**: potentially insolvable (S_n possible)
- **Automorphy**: requires strong Artin conjecture for insolvable cases
- **L-functions**: NEW, richer sector structure than Level 1

### Level 3: Lie type (Type III: PSL_n(F_q), Sp_{2n}(F_q), etc.)
- **Status**: Theoretical framework exists
- **Key insight**: For non-CM varieties, the Galois image on torsion IS a Lie-type group
- **Sector decomposition**: by Deligne-Lusztig theory (principal series, cuspidal, etc.)
- **Output**: RECOVERS standard Langlands L-functions
- **The merger**: Level 3 extractors reproduce existing theory, providing a combinatorial construction of known objects

### Level 4: Sporadic (Type IV: 26 exceptions)
- **Status**: Feasible for Mâ‚â‚, Mâ‚â‚‚; intractable for Monster
- **Natural objects**: Steiner systems, codes, lattices
- **Connection**: Monster â†’ j-function â†’ moduli of elliptic curves â†’ Moonshine
- **Output**: exceptional L-functions, finitely many per sporadic group
- **Open**: relationship to Moonshine conjectures

## Key Structural Results

### Result 1: Galois = Arithmetic â‰€ Symmetry

The Galois group of extracted number fields always has wreath product structure where the symmetry contribution comes from the map automorphism group and the arithmetic contribution comes from complex conjugation.

### Result 2: The Level 3 Merger

When the input symmetry is a group of Lie type (specifically, the Galois image on torsion of a non-CM variety), the extractor **reproduces** the standard Langlands machinery. The sector decomposition by Deligne-Lusztig characters corresponds to the automorphic decomposition. This means:
- Levels 1-2 produce genuinely new L-functions
- Level 3 provides a new construction of known L-functions  
- Level 4 is exceptional

### Result 3: Branching Rules Determine Everything

The representation-theoretic content of a spectral extractor is entirely captured by the **branching rule** from the full symmetry group G to the residual symmetry group H âŠ‚ G:

    (irrep of G) â†“ H = âŠ• (irreps of H with multiplicities)

The multiplicities determine sector dimensions. The sector characteristic polynomials determine number fields. The CFSG constrains which branching rules can occur.

### Result 4: Irreducibility from Representation Theory

When the vacuum eigenspace is an irreducible representation of the full automorphism group (as Ï‡â‚† of PSLâ‚‚(7) is for Kâ‚ˆ), the irreducibility of the vacuum polynomial over Q follows from representation theory. The Gram matrix does NOT commute with PSLâ‚‚(7) (it only commutes with Zâ‚‡), so Schur's lemma doesn't force the polynomial to be linear. But the dimension match (6 = 6) and the branching rule provide the structural explanation.

### Result 5: Quadratic Residues Are Directions

For the Kâ‚ˆ prototype: the three direction classes of the Heawood map correspond to the three cosets of the quadratic residue subgroup {1, 2, 4} in Fâ‚‡*/{Â±1}. The Zâ‚ƒ permuting direction classes is the Frobenius acting on the quadratic character. This connects the surface geometry to class field theory directly.

## Computable Next Steps

1. **PSLâ‚‚(7) decomposition of Kâ‚ˆ matchings**: Same data, larger symmetry. Test whether Ï‡â‚† accounts for the vacuum. Requires computing the 105-dim permutation character of PSLâ‚‚(7) on matchings.

2. **Mâ‚â‚ on S(4,5,11) blocks**: 66 blocks, 11 conjugacy classes. Fully tractable with standard character theory. Would produce the first sporadic extractor.

3. **Mâ‚â‚‚ on S(5,6,12) blocks**: 132 blocks, 15 conjugacy classes. Feasible with computational algebra systems (GAP/Magma).

4. **Z[i] curve with 13-torsion**: Same extractor framework but Z[i] instead of Z[Ï‰], with 3 direction classes. Tests whether the pipeline works for different CM rings.

## What the CFSG Guarantees

The classification theorem says these four levels **exhaust** all possibilities. There is no fifth type of finite simple group, hence no fifth level of spectral extractor. Every equivariant bilinear form on a finite G-set, for any finite group G, has its symmetry organized by composition factors drawn from exactly these four families.

This means the spectral extractor framework, indexed by the CFSG, provides a **complete** taxonomy of all possible ways to extract arithmetic from symmetry breaking on finite combinatorial structures coupled to CM varieties.
