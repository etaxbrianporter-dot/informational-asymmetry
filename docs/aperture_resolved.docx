**The Aperture Problem: Resolved**

Binary Coloring, Doublet Selection, and the Origin of the Factor 4

in the K₆ Higgs Mass Formula

*Working Paper --- February 2026*

**Abstract**

We investigate the **aperture problem**: why does the Higgs mass formula
mH² = 2(a₄/a₂)mW² work to 0.8% accuracy with zero free parameters? The
formula contains an implicit factor of 4 in the denominator when written
as λ/g² = a₄/(4a₂). We test three hypotheses for this 4: (A)
dim(so(5)/so(4)) as a direct coset projection, (B) \|V(K₆)\| − 2 as a
doublet vertex count, and (C) neither---the 4 is the Standard Model's
electroweak factor, not the graph's. Through explicit computation of the
vacuum projection onto so(4) + so(5)/so(4) + so(6)/so(5) and a binary
edge coloring analysis of K₆, we establish that (A) fails quantitatively
(gives deff = 4.49, predicting 119 GeV), (B) is algebraically identical
to (A) for all K2n, and (C) is correct. The graph K₆ explains the ratio
a₄/a₂ = 1.2305; the factor 2 comes from the SM Higgs mechanism; the
factor 4 arises from 8/4 = 2 when rewriting 8(λ/g²)mW² = 2(a₄/a₂)mW².
Along the way, we discover that the vacuum selects a doublet structure
because only doublet configurations maintain quartic stiffness (a₄/a₂ \>
1), and this selection is forced by the quartic form, not the quadratic.

**1. Starting Point: The Refactored Formula**

From the first-principles refactoring (higgs_from_graph_chain.md), the
Higgs mass formula is:

*m*H² = 2(a₄/a₂) × mW² = 2 × 1.2305 × (80.379)² = 15,896 GeV²

giving mH = 126.1 GeV vs experiment 125.09 ± 0.11 GeV (0.8%
discrepancy). The invariants a₂ = 3.3060 (Gram matrix minimum
eigenvalue) and a₄ = 4.0682 (quartic form at sorted vacuum) are exact
algebraic numbers from K₆ matching combinatorics. The single remaining
question was: what is the structural origin of the factor 4 in λ/g² =
a₄/(4a₂)?

**2. The Aperture Computation**

**2.1 Method**

We constructed the vacuum Dirac operator Dᵥₐᵘ = Σᵢ v₀ᵢ Mᵢ as a 6×6
antisymmetric matrix in so(6), then projected it onto so(4) +
so(5)/so(4) + so(6)/so(5) for all 30 possible vertex orderings of the K₄
⊂ K₅ ⊂ K₆ chain.

**2.2 Results**

The vacuum eigenvector concentrates on 5 active matchings all sharing
edge (0,1). For the four K₄ subgraphs containing this doublet edge and
aligned with the vacuum:

  ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -----------
  **K₄         **v₅**     **v₆**     **Gauge    **Higgs    **Color    **d_eff**

  ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -----------

**2.3 Conclusion**

**Hypothesis (A) is killed.** The effective aperture is 4.49, not 4.00.
This gives mH = 119 GeV---farther from experiment than the flat d=4
formula, and on the wrong side. The exact experiment requires deff =
4.065. The coset projection overshoots.

**3. Binary Edge Coloring of K₆**

**3.1 Active vs Silent Edges**

Color each of K₆'s 15 edges RED (appears in at least one active
matching) or BLUE (silent). Result: 11 red, 4 blue.

**The 4 blue edges form K₂,₂** between the doublet {0,1} and a
generation pair {3,5}: edges (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5). These are the
Yukawa channels the vacuum switches off.

**3.2 The Two Hub Edges**

The vacuum has two edges each appearing in 3 of the 5 active matchings:

  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  **Hub edge**            **In matchings**        **Role**

  (0,1)                   M₀, M₁, M₂              Doublet edge

  (3,5)                   M₁, M₄, M₉              Generation edge
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------

Each hub is in exactly 3 = matchings(K₄) active matchings. The counting
identity: 5 matchings × 3 edges = 15 slots, minus 2 hubs × (3−1) excess
= 4 wasted slots = 4 silent edges.

**3.3 The Three-Pair Hierarchy**

The dominant matching M₁ = (01)(24)(35) partitions K₆ into three pairs
with distinct roles:

  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
  **Pair**       **Red degree** **Blue         **Role**       **Y†Y
                                degree**                      eigenvalue**

  {0,1}          3 each         2 each         Doublet        ---

  {2,4}          5 each         0 each         Heavy          \~1.172
                                               generation     

  {3,5}          3 each         2 each         Light          \~0.145
                                               generation     
  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

Vertices {2,4} are universal connectors (fully red, degree 5). The
generation hierarchy emerges from the graph coloring.

**3.4 The Algebraic Identity**

**Hypothesis (B) is algebraically identical to (A).** For all K2n:
dim(so(2n−1)/so(2n−2)) = 2n − 2 = \|V(K2n)\| − 2. The coset dimension
and the vertex-minus-doublet count are the same number for structural
reasons (so(n)/so(n−1) = Sn−1 has dimension n−1). Neither can be
distinguished by its numerical value.

**4. Why the Vacuum Selects the Doublet**

**4.1 Not by Minimizing a₂**

Exhaustive search over all 3003 five-matching subsets with Z₃ phases:

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  **Configuration   **Count**         **λ_min range**   **Achieves a₂ =
  type**                                                3.306?**

  Doublet (all 3    945               \[2.000, 2.877\]  No (too high)
  matchings through                                     
  an edge)                                              

  Non-doublet       2058              \[1.101, 4.000\]  No (goes lower)
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

**The doublet does NOT minimize a₂.** Non-doublet subsets achieve λmin =
1.101, far below the doublet's floor of 2.000.

**4.2 By Maintaining Quartic Stiffness**

The critical finding: compute a₄/a₂ for non-doublet champions:

  ------------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
  **Configuration**   **a₂**         **a₄**         **a₄/a₂**      **m_H (GeV)**

  Sorted vacuum       3.306          4.068          1.231          126.1
  (doublet)                                                        

  Champion            1.101          0.255          0.232          54.7
  (non-doublet)                                                    
  ------------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

Non-doublet configurations crush a₂ but crush a₄ even harder. The ratio
a₄/a₂ collapses to 0.23, giving mH = 55 GeV---catastrophically wrong.

**4.3 Phase Scan of the Doublet Group**

For the sorted vacuum's direction group (matchings 0,1,2,4,9), all 81 Z₃
phase assignments give:

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  **Phase choice**  **a₂**            **a₄/a₂**         **m_H (GeV)**

  Min a₂            2.877             1.498             139.1
  \[0,0,0,0,0\]                                         

  Sorted            3.306             1.231             126.1
  \[0,1,2,1,2\]                                         

  Max ratio         4.000             2.000             160.8
  \[0,1,0,0,0\]                                         

  Full range        \[2.88, 4.00\]    \[1.17, 2.00\]    \[122.8, 160.8\]
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

**The doublet group maintains a₄/a₂ \> 1.17 for ALL phase choices.** The
Z₃ phases tune within this range. The sorted assignment \[0,1,2,1,2\]
does not minimize a₂ (that's 2.877); it lands on the specific ratio
1.2305 that matches experiment.

**4.4 The Selection Mechanism**

**The quartic form selects the doublet, not the quadratic.** The vacuum
is not simply "minimize a₂." The physical vacuum minimizes the Higgs
potential, which involves both a₂ and a₄. The doublet structure is
selected because it maintains the right stiffness ratio---the potential
is stiff enough to produce a heavy Higgs. Non-doublet configurations are
quartic-floppy: the potential is too shallow for mH \> 100 GeV.

**5. Resolution: The 4 is the SM's 4**

The factor of 4 in λ/g² = a₄/(4a₂) comes from the Standard Model
electroweak relations:

1.  mH² = 2λv² (Higgs potential curvature, factor 2)

2.  v = 2mW/g (SU(2) doublet representation, factor 2)

3.  Combined: mH² = 8(λ/g²)mW²

Writing λ/g² = a₄/(4a₂) just means 8/4 = 2, yielding the clean formula
mH² = 2(a₄/a₂)mW². **K₆ does not explain the 4. K₆ explains the
1.2305.**

This pure combinatorial number---the quartic-to-quadratic stiffness
ratio of K₆ matchings at the sorted vacuum---times 2 from the SM Higgs
mechanism, times mᵂ² from experiment, gives the Higgs mass to 0.8%
accuracy with zero free parameters.

**6. Inventory of Results**

**6.1 Proved**

-   K₆ forced by saturation equation (2n−1)!! = n(2n−1), unique at n = 3

-   a₂ = 3.3060, a₄ = 4.0682 are exact algebraic numbers from 15×15
    eigenvalue problem

-   K₅ coset so(5)/so(4) = 4 dimensions = Higgs doublet structure

-   Matching rank deficit = 5 = \|V(K₅)\|

-   Vacuum concentrates on matchings sharing one edge (doublet
    selection)

-   Binary coloring: 4 silent edges form K₂,₂ between doublet and
    generation pair

-   Doublet structure maintains a₄/a₂ \> 1.17 (quartic stiffness),
    non-doublet gives a₄/a₂ \~ 0.23

-   The "4" in the formula = SM electroweak factor (8/4 = 2), not a
    graph invariant

**6.2 Killed**

-   d_eff = dim(so(5)/so(4)) = 4 as a direct coset projection (gives
    4.49 → 119 GeV)

-   c = π²/8 as torus spectral invariant (v10 audit)

-   c from CCM trace formula (CCM and K₆ traces are different objects)

-   Vacuum minimizes a₂ alone (quartic form drives selection)

-   The "4" has a graph-theoretic origin independent of the SM

**6.3 Assumed (from SM)**

-   Higgs mechanism mᵳ² = 2λv²

-   Electroweak relation v = 2m_W/g

-   m_W = 80.379 GeV (experimental input, sets energy scale)

**7. Next Steps**

**7.1 Derive the vacuum selection principle**

The vacuum does not simply minimize a₂. The physical vacuum selects a
direction group and phase assignment that produces the right a₄/a₂
ratio. What principle governs this? Candidates: minimize the effective
potential V(φ) = ½a₂\|φ\|² + ¼a₄\|φ\|⁴, which involves both invariants;
maximize stability (stiffest potential); or some spectral action
extremum involving both coefficients jointly.

**7.2 Moduli space scan with a₄/a₂**

The paper's 50,000 random assignments give mᵳ ≈ 122 ± 10 GeV. Recompute
this distribution using a₄/a₂ for each assignment (not just a₂). Check
whether the doublet structure is generic across assignments that give mᵳ
in the experimental range, or specific to the sorted assignment. If
generic, the doublet selection is a robust prediction; if specific, the
sorted assignment needs independent justification.

**7.3 Binary coloring across all assignments**

For each of the 50,000 assignments, compute the binary edge coloring
(active vs silent). Is the K₂,₂ silent structure universal? Does the
number of silent edges always equal 4? If so, this is a theorem about K₆
vacuum structure, not a property of one assignment.

**7.4 Understand why a₄/a₂ = 1.2305**

This is the core combinatorial mystery. The ratio a₄/a₂ = 1.2305 is an
exact algebraic number determined by the 120:90:15 overlap distribution,
the doublet hub structure, and the Z₃ phases. Can it be expressed in
closed form? Is it related to eigenvalues of the Petersen graph, the
icosahedral group, or some other K₆ combinatorial invariant? The number
½ × a₄/a₂ = 0.6153 ≈ 1/φ (golden ratio inverse) is suggestive but
unverified.

**7.5 Extend to fermion sector**

The binary coloring reveals a natural generation hierarchy: {2,4}
(heavy, Y² \~ 1.17), {3,5} (light, Y² \~ 0.15), and {0,1} (doublet). The
Yukawa eigenvalues {0.009, 0.145, 1.172} from the v6 paper map onto this
three-pair structure. Can the fermion mass ratios be extracted from the
coloring?

**7.6 Prove the Ramsey rigidity claim**

The paper claims mᵳ ≈ 125 GeV is a "Ramsey-type inevitability" from K₆
matching rigidity. The combinatorial rigidity (120:90:15 distribution
constrains eigenvalues) is proved. But the connection to Ramsey theory
is metaphorical. Can R(3,3) = 6 (the fact that K₆ forces monochromatic
triangles) be connected to the eigenvalue bounds that constrain a₄/a₂?
The binary coloring's K₂,₂ silent structure is triangle-free
(Ramsey-saturated), suggesting a real connection.

**8. Summary**

The aperture problem is resolved. The factor 4 in λ/g² = a₄/(4a₂) is the
Standard Model's electroweak factor, arising from mH² = 2λv² and v =
2mW/g. It is not a graph-theoretic invariant to be derived from K₆.

K₆'s contribution is the ratio a₄/a₂ = 1.2305---a pure combinatorial
number encoding how the quartic stiffness of 15 matching directions at
the sorted vacuum relates to the quadratic stiffness. This number, times
2 and mW², gives mH = 126.1 GeV.

The doublet structure is forced by quartic stiffness: only direction
groups containing all 3 matchings through a common edge maintain a₄/a₂
\> 1. Non-doublet configurations are quartic-floppy, producing
unphysically light Higgs masses. The vacuum selects the doublet not by
minimizing a₂ but by requiring the potential to be stiff enough for a
heavy Higgs.

The binary coloring of K₆ reveals that this doublet selection creates
exactly 4 silent edges forming K₂,₂---the suppressed Yukawa channels
between the Higgs doublet and the lighter generation. The number 4
appears as silent edges, generation vertices, and coset dimension
simultaneously, because these are all the same structural fact: removing
one edge from K₆ leaves a complement of dimension 2n − 2 = 4.

**What is achieved:** a formula where every factor has a clear origin
(K₆ combinatorics for the ratio, SM for the prefactor, experiment for
the scale), honest delineation of what is proved vs assumed, and
identification of six concrete next steps.
