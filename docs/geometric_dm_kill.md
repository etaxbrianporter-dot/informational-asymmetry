# Geometric Dark Matter: Definitive Kill

## February 21, 2026 — Late Afternoon

## Result

**Every geometric dark matter mechanism within the K₂ₙ matching framework is killed.** The framework is SILENT on dark matter. This is an honest, falsifiable prediction.

## The Structural Reason (Why Dark Energy Works But Dark Matter Doesn't)

The dimension deficit f(ε) = A/(ε²·ln(ε)) is tiny at all astrophysical scales — ranging from 10⁻¹⁰⁸ at galactic scales to 10⁻¹²⁶ at the Hubble scale.

**Dark energy works** because Λ_CC enters through the a₀ coefficient (the volume integral):

Λ_CC = f(ε) × Λ⁴/M_Pl² ~ 10⁻¹²² × 10¹²² = O(1) in natural units

The tiny f is multiplied by the enormous cutoff scale Λ⁴, producing an observable effect. The cosmological constant is a VOLUME integral — the entire observable universe contributes coherently.

**Dark matter fails** because it requires an O(1) modification to the local gravitational FORCE LAW:

v²(r) = GM/r^{1-f(r)} ≈ (GM/r)(1 + f(r)·ln r)

With f ~ 10⁻¹⁰⁸ to 10⁻¹¹², the correction is 10⁻¹⁰⁸ of the Newtonian value. Dark matter phenomenology requires corrections of order 4-5× at galaxy outskirts.

**There is no amplification mechanism.** Dark energy benefits from volume amplification (a₀ = ∫√g d⁴x). Dark matter would need force amplification, but the spectral action has no such channel — the gravitational coupling a₂ is a combinatorial invariant (Gravitational Complementarity Theorem), immune to d_eff corrections.

## Kill Chain (6 Independent Kills)

### Kills 1-4: Particle Dark Matter (from prior dark matter probe)
1. **K₁₀ mass + lifetime:** 854 GeV but τ ≈ 10⁻⁷ s (24 orders short of cosmological stability)
2. **ℤ₃ coset anomaly:** Charge-conserving fraction = 33.3% = random. No selection rule.
3. **CP mismatch:** Derived CP at K₁₀ works AGAINST stability
4. **g²_total = 1 identity:** Cross-level coupling order-one at every level, increasing with level

### Kill 5: Hopping Perturbation (this session)
Boundary perturbation δ_i in hopping parameters gives:
- Quadratic response coefficient c₃ ≈ 0.3 (constant in ε)
- Perfect ℤ₃ symmetry: all three perturbation directions give identical response
- With physical mapping δ ~ |Φ|/c² ~ 10⁻⁶ for galaxies: Δf/f₀ = 0.3 × 10⁻¹² = 3×10⁻¹³

**12 orders of magnitude too small.**

### Kill 6: Local ε Variation (this session)
If ε_local = L_curv/L_Pl varies with position:
- f(10⁵⁴) ~ 10⁻¹⁰⁸ at galaxy center
- f(10⁵⁶) ~ 10⁻¹¹² at galaxy edge
- Relative variation: 10⁴× (f is 10,000× larger at the center)
- Absolute correction to gravity: 10⁻¹⁰⁸

**≥108 orders of magnitude too small.** And the variation has the WRONG profile (stronger correction at center, not at edge).

## New Discoveries from This Session

### Perturbation Response Coefficient
The d_eff response to traceless boundary perturbation:

f(ε, δ) ≈ f₀(ε) × (1 + c₃ δ²)

**c₃ ≈ 0.3** (dimensionless, approximately ε-independent)

Verified at ε = 5 through 500, δ = 0.001 through 0.8. The response is:
- Quadratic in δ for small δ (linear term vanishes by ℤ₃ symmetry)
- ℤ₃ symmetric to 10-digit precision
- Non-monotonic at large δ (gap opening causes f to decrease for δ > 0.5)
- Trace mode (uniform scaling) gives 100× larger response than anisotropic mode

### Coupling Formula (from Part 1)
Cross-level coupling g²_internal(n) = n(3n−2)/[(n+1)(3n−1)]

Verified at four transitions (K₆→K₈ through K₁₂→K₁₄).

## What This Means

The K₂ₙ matching framework makes a clear, falsifiable prediction:

**There is no dark matter mechanism within the framework.**

This means one of:
1. Dark matter is real physics from outside the matching chain (new sector, axions, sterile neutrinos — something the K₂ₙ tower doesn't encode)
2. Dark matter is not particles and not geometric in the d_eff sense — perhaps a different kind of gravitational modification
3. Dark matter observations have an alternative explanation that doesn't require new physics or modified gravity

The framework confidently predicts dark ENERGY (geometric, Λ_CC ~ 10⁻¹²²) and is confidently SILENT on dark MATTER. This asymmetry is structural: dark energy couples through a₀ (volume, amplified by Λ⁴), while dark matter would need to couple through the force law (not amplified by anything).
