## Status: CONJECTURED (with map identified)

**Prediction:** Ω_DM/Ω_b = Σ_{n=5}^{10} a₂(K₂ₙ) / a₂(K₈) = 72615269/13302432 ≈ **5.459**

**Observed:** 5.364 ± 0.065 (Planck 2018). **Tension: 1.5σ.**

## The Idea

Dark matter is not a particle or a force modification. It is an energy budget entry.

The spectral action Tr(f(D²/Λ²)) counts eigenvalues. Below K₈, the hyperelliptic window is open — eigenvalues couple to gauge fields and photons. Visible matter. Above K₈, the window is closed — eigenvalues contribute to the gravitational content through a₂ but cannot couple to photons. They gravitate but don't shine.

The ratio Ω_dark/Ω_visible = (invisible a₂ sum) / (visible a₂).

The framework predicts exactly **6 invisible levels** (K₁₀ through K₂₀), determined not by a free parameter but by the arithmetic of K₈'s cyclic symmetry.

## The ℤ₇ Gap Map

### The mechanism

K₈ has cyclic symmetry ℤ₇ acting on its ring subgraph K₇. The Heawood direction structure (Paper III) classifies all 28 edges into 4 direction classes of 7 edges each, determined by |i − j| mod 7. The electromagnetic vertex in the spectral action is a direction-dependent phase exp(2πi · d_k / 7).

For a level K₂ₙ with cyclic symmetry ℤ_{2n−1} to couple to K₈'s photon, it must carry compatible direction phases. The phase exp(2πi/7) is a (2n−1)-th root of unity if and only if 7 divides (2n−1).

**Rule:** Level K₂ₙ is electromagnetically dark to K₈ iff 7 ∤ (2n−1).

### The count

Between 7 and 21 (consecutive odd multiples of 7), the odd integers are:

    7 — K₈ (visible, ℤ₇ compatible)
    9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 — K₁₀ through K₂₀ (DARK, ℤ₇ incompatible)
    21 — K₂₂ (ℤ₇ re-embeds via ℤ₂₁ = ℤ₃ × ℤ₇)

Dark count = (21 − 7)/2 − 1 = **6** = p − 1 for p = 7.

This is arithmetic, not a choice. The number 6 is forced by the prime 7.

### Generality

The formula is universal: for K_{2n₀} with symmetry ℤ_p (p = 2n₀ − 1), the number of dark levels before ℤ_p re-embedding is always p − 1:

| Level | p = 2n₀−1 | Dark levels | Count = p−1 |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| K₄   | 3         | K₆, K₈     | 2 ✓         |
| K₆   | 5         | K₈..K₁₄    | 4 ✓         |
| K₈   | 7         | K₁₀..K₂₀   | 6 ✓         |
| K₁₀  | 9         | K₁₂..K₂₆   | 8 ✓         |

### Why 2g + 2 = p − 1

The Weierstrass count (2g + 2 branch points) agrees with the arithmetic count (p − 1 dark levels) in the hyperelliptic window because the Ringel-Youngs formula gives g(K₂ₙ) = n − 2 precisely when n ≤ 4:

    2g + 2 = 2(n−2) + 2 = 2n − 2 = (2n−1) − 1 = p − 1

This identity holds only for K₄, K₆, K₈ — the visible sector. The arithmetic argument (ℤ₇ gap) is more fundamental. The topological argument (Weierstrass points) gives the same answer as a consequence of the small-genus accident.

### Termination: what happens at K₂₂?

K₂₂ has ℤ₂₁ = ℤ₃ × ℤ₇ symmetry. The ℤ₇ subgroup (generated by i → i + 3 mod 21) acts within each of K₂₂'s 11 direction classes, splitting each class of 21 edges into 3 ℤ₇-orbits of 7 edges. K₂₂ can carry K₈'s direction labels — the photon vertex exists in principle.

K₂₂ terminates the dark run but does not enter K₈'s energy accounting. Each ℤ₇-compatible level anchors its own cycle: K₈ "owns" K₁₀–K₂₀. K₂₂ starts a new cycle (K₂₄–K₃₄). Higher cycles are decoupled from K₈'s photon by exponential mass growth (m(n) ~ exp(0.175n²), reaching ~10⁹ GeV by K₂₂).

## The Exact Computation

### Proved: a₂(K₂ₙ) = n(3n−4) / ((2n−1)(2n−3))

### Dark tower sum

| Level | n  | a₂ (exact)   | a₂ (float)  | Cumulative ratio |
|-------|----|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| K₁₀  | 5  | 55/63        | 0.87302     | 0.955           |
| K₁₂  | 6  | 28/33        | 0.84848     | 1.883           |
| K₁₄  | 7  | 119/143      | 0.83217     | 2.793           |
| K₁₆  | 8  | 32/39        | 0.82051     | 3.691           |
| K₁₈  | 9  | 69/85        | 0.81176     | 4.578           |
| K₂₀  | 10 | 260/323      | 0.80495     | **5.459**       |

### Prediction

    Ω_DM/Ω_b = 72615269/13302432 = 5.4588

    Observed (Planck 2018, TT+TE+EE+lowE+lensing):
    Ω_c h²/Ω_b h² = 0.1200/0.02237 = 5.364 ± 0.065

    Tension: 1.5σ

Links 1–6 are proved. Links 7–8 are the physical interpretation that connects the arithmetic to cosmology.

## What This Is NOT

All 7 particle/mechanism kills stand:

1. K₁₀ lifetime: 10⁻⁷ s (24 orders too short)
2. ℤ₃ coset charge: 33.3% = random (no conserved quantum number)
3. CP mismatch: 0/105 overlap (no cross-level CP conservation)
4. g²_total = 1: coupling identity (no level is decoupled)
5. Tower thresholds: 69 orders too small
6. Hopping perturbation: 12 orders too small
7. Spectral ratio response: wrong sign and 13 orders too small

Dark matter in this framework is not a particle. It is the gravitational shadow of the K₂ₙ tower above the hyperelliptic window — eigenvalues that enter the Einstein-Hilbert term but not the Yang-Mills term.

## The 1.5σ Residual

The predicted ratio 5.459 exceeds observed 5.364 by 1.77%. Possible resolutions:

**Experimental:** 1.5σ tension. CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD will tighten both Ω_b h² and Ω_c h² significantly.

**Shared normalization:** The gauge coupling program has a ~2.5% residual ("last 2.5% problem"). If a single hypercharge normalization correction affects both gauge couplings and the energy budget, it could close both gaps simultaneously. The dark matter δ ~ 1.8% and gauge δ ~ 2.5% are the same order.

**Higgs fraction:** Adding ~1.6% of a₂(K₆) to the visible denominator hits 5.364 exactly. The physical Higgs fraction of baryon mass (~1%) is in the right ballpark.

---

## What Would Promote to DERIVED

1. **Rigorous proof that ℤ₇-incompatible levels decouple from photons.** Currently Link 2 is structural (the spectral action vertex requires direction phases), but a formal derivation from the NCG action would be stronger.

2. **Principled resolution of the 1.77% residual.** Either a correction with structural origin or an improved measurement consistent with 5.459.

3. **Independent confirmation of mass growth law.** Currently extrapolated from 3 data points. Need K₁₂ and K₁₄ mass scales.

## What Would KILL

1. Proof that ℤ₇-incompatible levels CAN couple to photons through a mechanism other than direction phases.
2. A convergent, parameter-free weighting scheme that produces a different value.
3. Experimental Ω_DM/Ω_b moving decisively away from 5.4–5.5.
4. Demonstration that K₂₂ is also dark (i.e., ℤ₇ re-embedding doesn't create a photon vertex), extending the dark tower beyond 6 levels.

## Connection to the Framework

The ℤ₇ gap map unifies three structural features:

- **Gauge group:** ℤ₇ direction structure → SU(3) × U(1) (Paper III)
- **Hyperelliptic window:** 2g + 2 = p − 1 = 6 in the visible sector (Ringel-Youngs)
- **Dark matter ratio:** p − 1 = 6 dark levels → Ω_DM/Ω_b ≈ 5.46 (this result)

All three come from the prime p = 7 — the cyclic symmetry of K₈. The gauge group, the window closure, and the dark matter fraction are three faces of the same arithmetic.
