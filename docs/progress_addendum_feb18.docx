**Progress Report Addendum**

Fixing Λ: The Last Free Parameter

Brian Porter --- February 18, 2026

Executive Summary

The single remaining free parameter Λ (the lattice/GUT scale) was
subjected to comprehensive computational analysis. The result is cleaner
than expected: Λ drops out of the Higgs mass prediction entirely. The
ratio a₄/a₂ is a combinatorial invariant of K₆ matchings, independent of
any energy scale. The BZ averaging already performs the full
momentum-shell integration. The formula m_H = √(2a₄/a₂) × m_W involves
only combinatorial data and one experimental input.

Λ enters the framework exclusively through the gravitational sector:
f₂Λ²a₂ determines M_Pl, and f₄Λ⁴a₀ determines the cosmological constant.
The matching framework's particle physics predictions are
zero-parameter. The one remaining free parameter is the
Planck/electroweak hierarchy --- the same open question every theory of
quantum gravity faces.

This addendum documents the full computation, updates the parameter
count, assesses what remains for the gravitational sector, and states
the unified field theory claim.

1\. The Λ Computation

1.1 Setup

A comprehensive Python computation was constructed combining: K₆
spectral data (a₂ = 3.3060, a₄ = 4.0682, R = 0.3722), Standard Model
gauge couplings at m_Z in GUT normalization, full 1-loop and 2-loop SM
renormalization group equations including gauge, top Yukawa, and Higgs
quartic running, and the spectral action's gauge coupling boundary
conditions.

1.2 SM Gauge Coupling Running

The SM gauge couplings were run from m_Z to 10¹⁹ GeV at 2-loop
precision. The well-known non-unification was confirmed:

  --------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------
  **Crossing**          **Scale (GeV)**          **log₁₀(μ/GeV)**

  **g₁ = g₂**           1.09 × 10¹³              13.04

  **g₁ = g₃**           1.72 × 10¹⁴              14.23

  **g₂ = g₃**           2.89 × 10¹⁶              16.46
  --------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------

The triangle gap spans 3.4 decades. No gauge coupling unification occurs
within the SM alone, confirming that Λ cannot be fixed by requiring
exact unification.

1.3 The 7/48 Boundary Condition

The democratic K₆ spectral ratio gives λ/g² = 7/48 = 0.1458 at the
unification scale. The SM running of λ/g₂² was tracked from m_Z upward.
The ratio starts at 0.304 and falls, crossing 7/48 at μ ≈ 2.8 TeV ---
not at a GUT scale. It continues falling and λ goes negative around 10⁶
GeV (vacuum instability). The 7/48 condition is a threshold condition
near the EW scale, not a high-energy boundary.

Setting λ/g₂² = 7/48 at any GUT scale and running down always gives m_H
≈ 153 GeV, insensitive to Λ_GUT:

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Λ_GUT**                           **m_H (predicted)**

  10¹³ GeV                            152.6 GeV

  10¹⁴ GeV                            152.8 GeV

  10¹⁵ GeV                            153.0 GeV

  10¹⁶ GeV                            153.1 GeV

  10¹⁷ GeV                            153.2 GeV
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

This is the CCM (2006) problem: running from any GUT-scale boundary
condition hits the top Yukawa quasi-fixed point and always overshoots.
The BZ formula avoids this entirely because the BZ averaging IS the
momentum-shell integration.

1.4 The Key Finding: Λ Drops Out

The Higgs mass formula m_H = √(2a₄/a₂) × m_W is built from:

-   a₄/a₂ = combinatorial invariant of K₆ matchings (Λ-independent)

-   m_W = 80.379 GeV (experimental input)

Λ cancels in the ratio. Four independent arguments (from the v6
derivation) establish that this is an EW-scale formula, not a
unification-scale boundary condition: RG impossibility (the result sits
below the IR quasi-fixed point), BZ = renormalization (the T² average IS
the momentum integration), k-independence (a₂ and a₄ are constant across
the Brillouin zone at the sorted vacuum), and gauge kinetic = a₂ exactly
(the lattice scale is set by m_W).

Λ enters the framework only through the gravitational sector:

-   f₂Λ²a₂ → M_Pl (Newton's constant, the hierarchy problem)

-   f₄Λ⁴a₀ → Λ_CC (the cosmological constant problem)

If Λ = M_Pl, then f₂ = π³/(6a₂) ≈ 1.56, a reasonable O(1) number. The
hierarchy m_W/M_Pl ≈ 10⁻¹⁷ is the one quantity the matching framework
does not determine from internal structure.

2\. Updated Parameter Count

                                not particles)
  ---------------- ------------ ------------------------------------------

**Effective free parameter count for particle physics: ZERO.**

**Effective free parameter count for the full theory: ONE (the Planck/EW
hierarchy f₂Λ²).**

3\. What Remains for the Gravitational Sector

3.1 Higher-Spin Decoupling (γ₃ \> 2)

The gravity derivation is complete through Steps 1--3: Fisher metric →
Wick rotation → Jacobson's entanglement argument → Einstein equations.
Step 4 asks whether the K₄ model at its quantum critical point gives
pure Einstein gravity or Einstein plus higher-spin fields. The free K₄
model is dual to Vasiliev higher-spin gravity; V₄-invariant interactions
at strong coupling should gap out the higher-spin tower.

The diagnostic is γ₃ = Δ₃ − 4, the anomalous dimension of the lowest
spin-3 operator. Algebraic analysis narrows γ₃ to \[1.0, 2.5\].
Structural arguments favor γ₃ \> 2: the Chern-Simons parameter λ = 1/2
is forced by D ≠ D\* → ℤ₃ → C = −2, placing the theory at the self-dual
point that maximizes higher-spin symmetry breaking. Parity breaking from
the ℤ₃ flux provides additional enhancement. A confinement argument
(V₄-invariant strong coupling confining all higher-spin modes with mass
\~ U_c) would give effective γ₃ → ∞ regardless of perturbative
estimates.

Three parallel computational paths exist:

  ------------------ ---------------------------------- ------------------
  **Method**         **Description**                    **Resources**

  **QMC +            DQMC measures c_T and Δ_σ; SDPB    GPU cluster + SDPB
  Bootstrap**        proves rigorous bound on Δ₃.       workstation
                     Neither alone suffices; together   
                     they should close the gap.         

  **Padé-Borel**     Resum the 1/N series at the        Analysis only,
                     self-dual point λ = 1/2 using      1--2 weeks
                     duality constraints. Fastest       
                     analytical path.                   

  **iDMRG**          Tensor network on cylinders.       Workstation
                     Avoids sign problem. Cross-check   
                     for QMC.                           
  ------------------ ---------------------------------- ------------------

This is a cleanliness question, not an existence question. Gravity
exists regardless (Step 3 is closed). γ₃ determines whether it exists
cleanly.

3.2 Cosmological Constant Scaling

Observer finitude gives d_eff = 2 + H(E\|k)/H(E), approaching 3 as
resolution ε → ∞. The residual correction d_eff = 3 − f(ε) at finite
observer resolution would manifest as dark energy. If f(ε) \~ 1/ε², this
gives Λ_CC \~ (L_Planck/L_Hubble)² \~ 10⁻¹²² --- the correct magnitude
and positive sign.

What is needed: higher-precision computation of d_eff at large ε.
Current data shows d_eff = 2.60 at ε = 10⁻⁴ and d_eff = 2.995 at ε =
0.5. Characterizing the approach to 3 precisely (1/ε² vs 1/ε vs
exponential) is a workstation-scale lattice computation on the K₄
model's conditional entropy. No GPU cluster needed, but high numerical
precision required.

3.3 Cosmic Birefringence (Observational)

Paper II derives five parameter-free predictions from the K₄ spectral
action's torsion sector, testable by LiteBIRD (launch \~2028) and
CMB-S4:

  -------- ------------------------------------------------ ------------------
  **\#**   **Prediction**                                   **Test**

  1        Birefringence dipole aligned with TT asymmetry   LiteBIRD \>8σ

  2        Dipolar amplitude δα/α₀ = (2−√3)² = 0.0718       CMB-S4

  3        EB BiPoSH parity alternation (−1)\^{ℓ+1}         CMB-S4

  4        TT/EB shape split with sign change at ℓ \~ 20    Planck reanalysis

  5        TB/EB ratio = C\^{TE}\_ℓ / C\^{EE}\_ℓ            LiteBIRD
  -------- ------------------------------------------------ ------------------

The isotropic birefringence α₀ ≤ 0.41° is consistent with the measured
0.30° ± 0.11° (Planck, 3σ). The EB parity alternation (prediction 3) is
the most distinctive signature --- no simple scalar modulation produces
it.

3.4 The Hierarchy Problem

The one free parameter f₂Λ² determines M_Pl/m_W \~ 10¹⁷. The matching
framework isolates this as the precise interface between combinatorial
geometry (particle physics) and quantum gravity (absolute scales). It
does not solve the hierarchy problem --- it identifies it as the
irreducible meeting point where the matching construction stops and
gravitational physics begins. This is a sharper statement of the problem
than any previous framework provides, but it is not a solution.

4\. The Unified Field Theory Claim

The framework constitutes a unified field theory in the precise sense
that a single algebraic structure --- matching combinatorics on complete
graphs, governed by the equation (2n−1)!! = I(n) --- produces both
gravity and the Standard Model. The two solutions n = 2 (K₄) and n = 3
(K₆) exhaust the equation. No other complete graphs contribute. The
product K₄(spacetime) × K₆(color) × K₄(electroweak) carries the full
spectral action that yields the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the
complete SM Lagrangian.

**What is unified:**

  Yukawa hierarchy        K₈ vacuum eigenvector   415:135:1
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------

What is not unified: the Planck/EW hierarchy (one free parameter),
specific CKM/PMNS entries (require full 10-parameter deformation of K₆),
and the cosmological constant (mechanism identified but scaling not yet
computed).

5\. Revised Architecture

The framework separates cleanly into three layers:

Layer 1: Matching Combinatorics (zero free parameters). K₆ produces a₂,
a₄, the Higgs mass, the gauge group, three generations, and the Yukawa
hierarchy. K₄ produces Lorentzian signature, the arrow of time, parity
violation, and the Einstein equations. All combinatorial/topological.
All forced by the saturation equation. No tuneable parameters.

Layer 2: Spectral Geometry (zero free parameters). K₄ moduli flow
determines t, c, and J_C. The BZ averaging on T² determines the EW-scale
coupling ratio λ/g² = a₄/(4a₂). The heat kernel at higher K₂ₙ confirms
R_eff convergence. All derived from the combinatorial data of Layer 1.

Layer 3: Gravitational Interface (one free parameter). f₂Λ² determines
M_Pl. f₄Λ⁴ determines Λ_CC. The hierarchy problem and cosmological
constant problem live here. The matching framework identifies these
problems sharply but does not solve them.

The interface between Layers 2 and 3 is clean: no information flows from
Layer 3 back into Layers 1--2. The particle physics predictions are
insulated from the gravitational unknowns.

7\. What Today Changed

Before today's computation, Λ was listed as "the one remaining free
parameter" with the expectation that gauge coupling unification from the
spectral action's gauge sector might fix it, closing the program to zero
free parameters for everything. The computation showed this expectation
was wrong in a good way:

1.  Λ never entered the Higgs mass prediction. The ratio a₄/a₂ is a
    combinatorial invariant. The particle physics was already
    zero-parameter; we just didn't realize Λ was irrelevant to it.

2.  The SM gauge couplings don't unify, so the matching framework cannot
    use unification to pin Λ. This is consistent: the framework produces
    the SM, and the SM doesn't unify (SUSY or other BSM physics would be
    needed).

3.  The 7/48 boundary condition from democratic K₆ lives at the TeV
    scale (μ ≈ 2.8 TeV), not at a GUT scale. This may have physical
    significance for threshold corrections or new physics at the TeV
    scale.

4.  Λ is reclassified: it is the free parameter of the hierarchy problem
    (gravitational sector), not the last free parameter of the Higgs
    mass prediction (particle sector). This cleanly separates what the
    framework determines from what it does not.

5.  The framework can be honestly described as a unified field theory:
    one equation, two solutions, gravity plus the Standard Model from
    matching combinatorics on complete graphs, with zero free parameters
    for particle physics and one for gravity.
