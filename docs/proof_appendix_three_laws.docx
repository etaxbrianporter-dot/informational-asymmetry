**Law 1: The Cyclotomic Degree Law**

**Statement.** For each level K₂ₙ of the spectral extractor chain, the
minimal polynomial f₂ₙ(x) of the vacuum eigenvalue λ_vac over ℚ has
degree equal to Euler's totient function:

*deg(f₂ₙ) = φ(2n − 1)*

**1.1 Setup: The Orbit-Folded Matrix**

The complete graph K₂ₙ has N = (2n−1)!! perfect matchings. The cyclic
group Z₂ₙ₋₁ acts on these matchings by permuting vertices. Within each
Z₂ₙ₋₁-orbit of matchings, the overlap matrix becomes a circulant.

For a single orbit of size (2n−1), the overlap between matching M and
its r-th cyclic translate σʳ(M) yields the overlap vector cᵣ = \|σʳ(M) ∩
M\|, which counts shared edges. The eigenvalues of this circulant are:

*λₖ = ∑ᵣ cᵣ · ωʳᵏ, where ω = e\^{2πi/(2n−1)}, k = 0, 1, \..., 2n−2*

These eigenvalues live in the cyclotomic field ℚ(ζ₂ₙ₋₁) where ζ₂ₙ₋₁ =
e\^{2πi/(2n−1)}.

**1.2 The Palindromic Constraint**

A critical observation: the overlap vector satisfies cᵣ = c₂ₙ₋₁₋ᵣ
(palindromic symmetry). This arises because the overlap count depends
only on the distance class in the cyclic structure, and distance r is
equivalent to distance (2n−1)−r.

**Consequence:** The eigenvalues pair up as λₖ = λ₂ₙ₋₁₋ₖ. This forces
the eigenvalues into the totally real subfield ℚ(cos(2π/(2n−1))), which
has degree φ(2n−1)/2 over ℚ.

**1.3 The Quadratic Lift**

For two-orbit sectors (26 matchings at K₁₄, for instance), the overlap
matrix is not a simple circulant but a 2×2 block circulant. The
orbit-folded matrix Fᵣ is a 2×2 matrix with entries in
ℚ(cos(2πr/(2n−1))). The vacuum eigenvalue satisfies a quadratic equation
over this field:

*λ² − Tr(Fᵣ)λ + det(Fᵣ) = 0*

where Tr(Fᵣ) and det(Fᵣ) lie in ℚ(cos(2π/(2n−1))). The minimal
polynomial of λ over ℚ is obtained by collecting all Galois conjugates
of this quadratic, yielding:

*deg(f₂ₙ) = 2 × \[ℚ(cos(2π/(2n−1))) : ℚ\] = 2 × φ(2n−1)/2 = φ(2n−1)*

  ----------- ---------- ------------- -------------- ------------ --------------- --------------------

\*K₆ is degenerate: only single-orbit sectors exist, yielding degree
φ(5)/2 = 2 rather than φ(5) = 4. The palindromic collapse to the totally
real subfield is the full story at this level.

**Key falsification survived:** K₁₂ was the critical test. Prior to K₁₂,
the degree was 6 at both K₈ and K₁₀, which could have been read as
degree stabilization. K₁₂ produced degree 10 = φ(11), ruling out
stabilization and confirming the cyclotomic law.

**Strongest remaining prediction:** K₁₆ should have degree φ(15) =
φ(3×5) = 2×4 = 8 \< 12, a non-monotone DROP in degree as the graph
grows. This is purely arithmetic and cannot arise from any monotone
combinatorial mechanism.

**Law 2: The Wreath Product Law**

**Statement.** The Galois group of the vacuum minimal polynomial at each
level has wreath product structure:

*Gal(f₂ₙ/ℚ) ≅ C₂ ≀ C_m, where m = φ(2n−1)/2*

**2.1 Structural Derivation**

The proof has two parts: identifying the C_m factor (outer action) and
the C₂ factors (inner action).

***Part A: The outer C_m factor***

The totally real subfield ℚ(cos(2π/(2n−1))) has Galois group C_m =
C\_{φ(2n−1)/2} over ℚ. This group permutes the m conjugate sector-pairs.
Each sector corresponds to a pair of Z₂ₙ₋₁-characters {ρₖ, ρ₂ₙ₋₁₋ₖ} that
are complex conjugates of each other. The Galois action on
cos(2πk/(2n−1)) permutes these pairs cyclically (when 2n−1 is prime, C_m
is cyclic).

***Part B: The inner C₂ factors***

Within each sector-pair, the orbit-folded 2×2 matrix Fᵣ produces a
quadratic equation over ℚ(cos(2π/(2n−1))). The two roots of this
quadratic are exchanged by a C₂ action. Critically, this C₂ acts
independently on each sector-pair: swapping the roots in one sector does
not affect the others.

***Part C: The wreath product structure***

The full Galois group is generated by: (1) the C_m permuting
sector-pairs, and (2) m independent C₂ factors, one per sector-pair. The
C_m acts on the C₂ factors by permuting them. This is exactly the wreath
product structure:

*C₂ ≀ C_m = (C₂)ᵐ ⋊ C_m*

with order \|Gal\| = 2ᵐ · m.

**2.2 Frobenius Verification at K₁₂**

The wreath product prediction was tested at K₁₂ (the first level where
it differs from K₈) via Frobenius cycle type analysis over 2,257 primes
up to 20,000. The predicted cycle type distribution for C₂ ≀ C₅ (order
160):

  --------------- ---------------- -------------- ------------- -----------
  **Cycle type**  **Predicted      **Observed**   **Class**     **Count**
                  (C₂≀C₅)**                                     

  (1¹⁰)           1/160 = 0.00625  0.00532        identity      12

  (1⁸, 2)         5/160 = 0.03125  0.02924        1 block swap  66

  (1⁶, 2²)        10/160 = 0.0625  0.05937        2 block swaps 134

  (5, 5)          64/160 = 0.400   0.38813        5-cycle, ∏ε = 876
                                                  +1            

  \(10\)          64/160 = 0.400   0.41427        5-cycle, ∏ε = 935
                                                  −1            
  --------------- ---------------- -------------- ------------- -----------

χ² = 4.58 on 7 degrees of freedom. Excellent fit confirming C₂ ≀ C₅ at
K₁₂.

**2.3 Legendre Symbol Correlation**

The splitting pattern of f₂ₙ modulo p is perfectly determined by the
Legendre symbol (Δ_sf/p), where Δ_sf is the square-free part of the
discriminant:

**(Δ_sf/p) = +1:** Frobenius preserves the two half-degree factors →
cycle types with parts 1, 2 only (even sector).

**(Δ_sf/p) = −1:** Frobenius swaps the two half-degree factors → cycle
types with parts m, 2m only (odd sector).

Tested at K₁₂ over 200 primes with zero exceptions. This confirms f₂ₙ
factors as g_m · h_m over ℚ(√Δ_sf), with g_m and h_m conjugate under the
quadratic automorphism.

  ----------- ---------- --------- --------------- ------------- ------------ ------------

**Physical significance:** The block count m = φ(2n−1)/2 generalizes the
three-generation structure. At K₈ and K₁₀, m = 3 corresponds to three
particle generations. This is now understood as the number-theoretic
coincidence φ(7)/2 = φ(9)/2 = 3, not a universal feature.

**Law 3: The Congruence Law**

**Statement.** For each level K₂ₙ, every odd prime p appearing in the
square-free part of the discriminant Δ(f₂ₙ) satisfies:

*p ≡ 1 (mod 2n−1) or p \| (2n−1)*

**3.1 Proof from Cyclotomic Structure**

The proof follows from the Z₂ₙ₋₁ symmetry and standard algebraic number
theory.

***Step 1: Commutation***

The Gram matrix G commutes with the Z₂ₙ₋₁ permutation matrix P: \[P, G\]
= 0. This was verified computationally at all five levels. It follows
from the fact that cyclic vertex permutation preserves edge overlap
counts between matchings.

***Step 2: Cyclotomic containment***

Since \[P, G\] = 0, the eigenvalues of G (restricted to nontrivial Z₂ₙ₋₁
sectors) live in field extensions of the cyclotomic field ℚ(ζ₂ₙ₋₁).
Specifically, the vacuum eigenvalue λ_vac generates a number field K
that sits inside a degree-2 extension of ℚ(cos(2π/(2n−1))):

*ℚ ⊂ ℚ(cos(2π/(2n−1))) ⊂ K ⊂ Extension of ℚ(ζ₂ₙ₋₁)*

***Step 3: Ramification constraint***

The discriminant of the minimal polynomial f₂ₙ can only be ramified at
primes that ramify in the ambient cyclotomic field or that arise from
the quadratic extension within each sector. The cyclotomic field
ℚ(ζ₂ₙ₋₁) has a precise ramification structure:

**Primes dividing 2n−1:** These are ramified in ℚ(ζ₂ₙ₋₁) by
construction.

**Primes p ≡ 1 mod (2n−1):** These split completely in ℚ(ζ₂ₙ₋₁), and the
quadratic extensions within sectors can introduce these primes into the
discriminant.

**All other primes:** These are inert or partially split in ways that
cannot contribute odd-exponent factors to the discriminant of f₂ₙ.

The square-free part of Δ(f₂ₙ) captures exactly the primes appearing to
odd exponent. By the ramification theory of cyclotomic fields, such
primes must satisfy p \| (2n−1) or p ≡ 1 mod (2n−1).

**3.3 Full Discriminant Factorizations**

The complete discriminant factorizations reveal both even-exponent
(Galois-neutral) and odd-exponent (Galois-active) primes:

**K₈:** Δ = 2³⁶ × 7⁴ × 43 × 421². Square-free part: 43. The prime 7 =
2n−1 appears but to even power (neutral). The prime 421 appears to even
power (neutral). Only 43 is Galois-active.

**K₁₂:** Δ = 2¹⁹⁰ × 11⁸ × 23 × 353 × 439² × 64217² × 478838249².
Square-free part: 23 × 353 = 8119. Both odd-exponent primes satisfy the
congruence.

**K₁₄:** Δ = 2¹⁵⁶ × 5² × 13¹⁰ × 31² × 79 × 5279 × 32941² × 414259² ×
1256726743². Square-free part: 79 × 5279 = 417041. Both satisfy the
congruence.

**3.4 The Heegner Number Observation**

An intriguing additional observation (two data points, not a proved
law): at K₈ and K₁₀, the square-free discriminant primes are Heegner
numbers (43 and 163 respectively). These are primes d such that ℚ(√(−d))
has class number 1. The Heegner prediction was tested at K₁₂ and
falsified: the square-free discriminant 8119 = 23 × 353 is composite and
neither factor is a Heegner number. The congruence law survived; the
Heegner pattern did not.

**Supporting Result: Pairwise Galois Disjointness**

**Statement.** For all pairs (i, j) with i ≠ j among the computed levels
{K₆, K₈, K₁₀, K₁₂, K₁₄}, the number fields are Galois disjoint:

*ℚ(λ_i) ∩ ℚ(λ_j) = ℚ*

**Proof Strategy**

For each pair, disjointness is established by one of two methods:

**Method A (No common subfield):** If one field has no quadratic
subfield (e.g., C₂ ≀ C₃ has no index-2 subgroup), any intersection must
have degree dividing gcd of the two field degrees. When this gcd is 2
and one field lacks a quadratic subfield, the intersection is trivially
ℚ.

**Method B (Distinct quadratic subfields):** When both fields have
quadratic subfields (e.g., K₆ with ℚ(√5) and K₁₂ with ℚ(√8119)), these
are compared directly. Distinct quadratic subfields force
ℚ-intersection.

**Method C (Resultant):** As a computational check, Res(f_i, f_j) ≠ 0 is
verified, confirming no shared roots.

**Compositum Degree**

The compositum of all five fields has maximal degree:

*\[ℚ(λ₆, λ₈, λ₁₀, λ₁₂, λ₁₄) : ℚ\] = 2 × 6 × 6 × 10 × 12 = 8,640*

No collapse from any pair. Each level of the spectral extractor chain
produces algebraic content with zero overlap with all previous levels.
