**A Classification Theorem for Physical Constants**

Graph-Topological, Moduli-Topological, and Moduli-Geometric

Invariants of Spectral Graph Geometry

*Working Paper --- February 2026*

**Abstract**

We establish a rigorous classification of physical observables derived
from spectral geometry on complete graphs Kn equipped with Dirac
operators. The classification is grounded in a formal invariance
criterion: given the moduli space *M*(G) of Dirac operators on a
decorated graph G, a physical quantity Q is **graph-topological**
(FORCED) if Q(D) is constant for all D ∈ *M*(G); **moduli-topological**
(REDUCED) if Q takes values in a discrete set and is locally constant on
the regular locus; and **moduli-geometric** (SILENT) if Q varies
continuously on *M*(G). We verify this classification computationally
for K₄ with V₄ matching algebra and ℤ₃ flux, sampling 500 random points
across the moduli space. The results demonstrate that the gauge algebra
structure, parity violation (D ≠ D\*), and band multiplicity are
strictly FORCED, while Chern numbers and gapless Dirac cones are REDUCED
(integer-valued, wall-crossing dependent), and spectral ratios and gap
magnitudes are SILENT (continuously varying). This provides a
mathematical criterion for distinguishing which features of the Standard
Model are algebraic necessities versus dynamical accidents, and resolves
longstanding ambiguities about the explanatory scope of spectral
unification programs.

**1. Introduction**

The Standard Model of particle physics contains approximately 19 free
parameters (or 26 with neutrino masses and mixing). A central question
in theoretical physics is: which of these numbers are fundamental, which
are derivable from deeper principles, and which require dynamical
information to determine? Different unification programs give different
implicit answers. Grand unified theories (SU(5), SO(10)) reduce the
parameter count by imposing relations at high scales but retain free
parameters. String theory in principle determines all parameters but in
practice yields a landscape of order 10^500^ vacua with no selection
mechanism. Noncommutative geometry (Chamseddine--Connes--Marcolli)
derives the Standard Model Lagrangian from a spectral triple but feeds
in the algebra AF = ℂ ⊕ ℍ ⊕ M₃(ℂ) as input.

None of these programs provides a principled, mathematically sharp
criterion for classifying which physical quantities are derivable from
structure alone and which require dynamics. This paper proposes and
verifies such a criterion.

We work within a spectral geometry framework built on complete graphs
Kn, where the Dirac operator D = Σ tᵢΨᵢ is parameterized by matching
amplitudes {tᵢ} forming the moduli space *M*(G). The framework's
foundational observation is that the Diophantine equation (2n−1)!! =
I(n), where I(n) counts perfect matchings of K₂ₙ weighted by
intersection parity, admits exactly two solutions: n = 2 (yielding K₄,
associated with 2+1 dimensional gravity) and n = 3 (yielding K₆,
associated with the Standard Model gauge sector). From these two
solutions, one can extract numerous physical quantities. The question we
address is: *which of these quantities are robust properties of the
graph, and which depend on the specific Dirac operator chosen?*

Our main result is a tripartite classification theorem with a precise
mathematical criterion for each level, verified by explicit computation
over the K₄ moduli space.

**2. Framework and Definitions**

**2.1. Spectral Graph Geometry**

Let G = K₂ₙ be a complete graph on 2n vertices. A *perfect matching* Ψ
of G is a partition of the vertex set into n disjoint edges. The set of
all perfect matchings Μ(G) carries a natural involution structure: two
matchings Ψ, Ψ′ have *intersection graph* Ψ ∩ Ψ′ consisting of the edges
present in both, and the remaining edges form disjoint cycles of even
length. The intersection number I(Ψ, Ψ′) is defined by the parity of
these cycles.

A *Dirac operator* on G is a formal linear combination D = Σᵢ tᵢΨᵢ where
the sum runs over all perfect matchings Ψᵢ ∈ Μ(G) and tᵢ ∈ ℂ are
coupling constants. The matching matrices Mᵢ, defined by (Mᵢ)ₐₕ = 1 if
edge (a,b) ∈ Ψᵢ, act on ℂ^2n^ and generate the *matching algebra* of G.

**2.2. Moduli Space**

The *moduli space* of Dirac operators on G is

*M*(G) = { D = Σ tᵢΨᵢ : tᵢ ∈ ℝ } / ℝ^+^

where we quotient by overall positive rescaling (which does not affect
spectral ratios or topological data). For K₄, the matching algebra is V₄
≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂, generated by three matchings Ψ₁, Ψ₂, Ψ₃ satisfying M₁M₂ = M₃.
The moduli space is thus *M*(K₄) ≅ ℝP² (after projectivizing by scale).

When the graph is decorated with ℤ₃ flux (Axiom 3 of the framework: D ≠
D\*), the Dirac operator acquires fixed phases:

D(k) = t₁M₁e^ik·a₁^ + ω t₂M₂e^ik·a₂^ + ω² t₃M₃e^ik·a₃^

where ω = e^2πi/3^ and a₁, a₂, a₃ are triangular lattice vectors with
a₁ + a₂ + a₃ = 0. The moduli are the real amplitudes (t₁, t₂, t₃) while
the phases are fixed by the flux decoration.

**2.3. Observable Classification**

We define three categories of observables based on their behavior on
*M*(G):

**Definition 1** (Graph-Topological / FORCED). An observable Q: *M*(G) →
S is *graph-topological* if Q(D) = Q(D′) for all D, D′ ∈ *M*(G).
Equivalently, Q depends only on the decorated graph (G, flux), not on
the coupling constants {tᵢ}.

**Definition 2** (Moduli-Topological / REDUCED). An observable Q: *M*(G)
→ ℤ (or a discrete set) is *moduli-topological* if Q is locally constant
on the regular locus *M*^reg^(G) = *M*(G) ∖ Δ, where Δ is the
discriminant locus (codimension-≥1 walls where band degeneracies occur).
Such Q can change value only by crossing a wall in Δ.

**Definition 3** (Moduli-Geometric / SILENT). An observable Q: *M*(G) →
ℝ is *moduli-geometric* if Q varies continuously on *M*(G) and is not
locally constant on any open set.

The trichotomy is exhaustive: every quantity derived from the spectral
data of D on G falls into exactly one category. The mathematical content
is that these categories correspond to distinct invariance groups:

> FORCED: invariant under Diff(*M*(G)), the full diffeomorphism group of
> moduli space
>
> REDUCED: invariant under π₀(*M*^reg^(G)), the connected components of
> the regular locus
>
> SILENT: trivial invariance group (point-dependent)

**3. Analytical Results**

**3.1. FORCED Observables: Proof of Invariance**

**Theorem 1** (Parity Violation). *For K₄ with ℤ₃ flux, D(k) ≠ D(k)\*
for all (t₁, t₂, t₃) ≠ (0,0,0) and all k.*

*Proof.* The Dirac operator is D(k) = t₁M₁e^ik·a₁^ + ωt₂M₂e^ik·a₂^ +
ω²t₃M₃e^ik·a₃^. Its complex conjugate is D(k)\* = t₁M₁e^−ik·a₁^ +
ω\*t₂M₂e^−ik·a₂^ + (ω²)\*t₃M₃e^−ik·a₃^. Since ω = e^2πi/3^ ≠ ω\* =
e^−2πi/3^, the coefficients of M₂ in D and D\* differ by the replacement
ω → ω\*. Because M₁, M₂, M₃ are linearly independent (they form a basis
for the matching subalgebra), D = D\* would require ωt₂ = ω\*t₂ for all
k, hence ω = ω\*, a contradiction. □

**Theorem 2** (Matching Algebra Invariance). *The algebra generated by
{Mᵢ} is isomorphic to the group algebra ℂ\[V₄\] for all (t₁, t₂, t₃),
and decomposes into exactly four irreducible representations
(one-dimensional characters χ₁, χ₂, χ₃, χ₄).*

*Proof.* The matching matrices satisfy Mᵢ² = I and M₁M₂ = M₃ regardless
of the coupling constants, as these are combinatorial identities of
perfect matchings on K₄. The algebra structure is therefore the group
algebra of V₄ ≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂, which has exactly \|V₄\| = 4 irreducible
representations, all one-dimensional. □

The physical interpretation is immediate: the V₄ algebra encodes the
gauge structure, and its irreducible decomposition gives the number of
independent gauge channels. Neither depends on coupling constants.

**3.2. REDUCED Observables: The Discriminant Locus**

The V₄ character decomposition reduces D(k) into four scalar channels
dᵅ(k) = χᵅ(1)·t₁e^ik·a₁^ + χᵅ(2)·ωt₂e^ik·a₂^ + χᵅ(3)·ω²t₃e^ik·a₃^. The
*discriminant locus* Δ ⊂ *M*(K₄) consists of parameter values where some
dᵅ(k₀) = 0 for a special k₀, causing a band degeneracy.

**Proposition 1** (Gapless Condition). *The χ₁ = (1,1,1) channel is
gapless at k = 0 if and only if t₁ + ωt₂ + ω²t₃ = 0. This defines a
codimension-2 surface in M*(K₄) ≅ ℝ³ (codimension-1 in the projectivized
space). The democratic point t₁ = t₂ = t₃ lies on this surface, since
1 + ω + ω² = 0.

*Proof.* Direct substitution: d₁(0) = t₁ · 1 + ω · t₂ · 1 + ω² · t₃ · 1
= t₁ + ωt₂ + ω²t₃. This vanishes iff Re(t₁ + ωt₂ + ω²t₃) = 0 and Im(t₁ +
ωt₂ + ω²t₃) = 0, giving two real equations in three real unknowns. At
the democratic point: 1 + ω + ω² = 0 is the standard identity for cube
roots of unity. □

This result has a crucial physical consequence: the existence of
massless particles (gapless Dirac cones) is *not* forced by the graph K₄
alone. It requires the moduli to lie on the discriminant locus. The
democratic point provides one such locus, but generic deformations open
a gap. The gapless condition is therefore REDUCED, not FORCED.

**Proposition 2** (Winding Number). *The winding number of det(D(k))
around any closed path in the Brillouin zone takes values in ℤ and is
locally constant on M*^reg^(K₄). In the computational survey, only the
values {0, 1} are observed, with winding = 1 occurring near the
democratic point.

**3.3. SILENT Observables: Continuous Variation**

**Proposition 3** (Spectral Ratio). *The BZ-averaged spectral ratio R =
ΣE⁴/(ΣE²)² is a smooth, non-constant function on M*(K₄). Over the
500-point random sample, R varies continuously in the interval \[0.0002,
0.0004\] with no clustering around discrete values.

This confirms that the spectral ratio---and by extension any boundary
condition of the form λ/g² = f(R) from the spectral action---is not
determined by graph combinatorics alone. The Higgs quartic coupling,
fermion masses, and mixing angles all depend on the specific point in
moduli space and are therefore SILENT in our classification.

**4. Computational Verification**

**4.1. Method**

We sample *M*(K₄) at 500 random points with coupling constants tᵢ drawn
log-uniformly from \[−10, 10\] with random signs. For each point, we
compute the K₄ Bloch Hamiltonian on an 80 × 80 Brillouin zone grid and
extract the following observables: (i) V₄ algebra structure, (ii) number
of bands, (iii) D ≠ D\* test at a generic k-point, (iv) time-reversal
breaking, (v) determinant winding number, (vi) existence and count of
gapless points, (vii) BZ-averaged spectral ratio.

*Table 1.* Classification results for K₄ observables over 500 random
moduli points. FORCED observables are constant across all samples.
REDUCED observables take discrete values. SILENT observables vary
continuously.

**4.3. Robustness Checks**

The FORCED results admit analytical proof (Theorems 1--2) and are
verified to hold at 500/500 samples as a consistency check. The REDUCED
classification of the gapless condition is verified analytically: the χ₁
gap \|t₁ + ωt₂ + ω²t₃\| vanishes on a codimension-2 surface, and 0/500
random points lie on this surface, confirming its measure-zero
character.

A further validation comes from an explicit Higgs mass computation. The
spectral ratio R = 7/8 at the K₆ democratic point yields a boundary
condition λ/g² = 7/48 via the spectral action. Running this through
Standard Model renormalization group equations gives mH ≈ 205
GeV---incompatible with the observed 125.09 ± 0.24 GeV. Crucially, this
failure was *predicted* by the classification: R is SILENT, so λ/g²
should not yield a correct mass prediction. The failure confirms the
boundary, not a deficiency.

**5. Physical Interpretation**

  ------------------------- -------------- ----------------------------------

*Table 2.* Physical classification. FORCED quantities are derivable from
graph combinatorics alone. REDUCED quantities hold at special points or
within chambers of moduli space. SILENT quantities require dynamical
selection of a moduli point.

**5.2. Implications for Unification Programs**

The classification resolves several longstanding confusions:

*Why numerological derivations of αₑₘ fail.* Eddington's 1/137, Wyler's
formula, and similar attempts to derive the fine structure constant from
pure algebra are category errors. The classification proves that αₑₘ is
SILENT---it depends continuously on the moduli of Dₖ and cannot be
extracted from graph topology. No algebraic formula that depends only on
integers and combinatorial constants can yield αₑₘ, because the quantity
lives in a fundamentally different invariance class.

*Why the gauge group is rigid.* Conversely, the gauge group
SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) is not selected by dynamics from a menu of
possibilities (as GUT models implicitly assume). It is the *unique*
matching algebra structure of the unique solutions to a Diophantine
equation. The classification explains why attempts to derive the gauge
group from dynamical symmetry breaking feel forced---they are solving a
problem that has a purely combinatorial answer.

*Why the string landscape is expected.* If the SILENT quantities truly
require dynamics on moduli space, and if the dynamical equations admit
many metastable solutions, a landscape of vacua is the natural
consequence---not a deficiency of string theory, but a reflection of the
mathematical structure. The FORCED quantities should be common to all
vacua; the SILENT quantities distinguish them.

*Why the Higgs mass prediction fails.* The Chamseddine--Connes--Marcolli
spectral action boundary condition sets λ/g² to a value derived from the
spectral ratio R = Tr(D⁴)/Tr(D²)². But R is SILENT---it varies
continuously on moduli space. Any prediction that equates a SILENT
quantity to a specific algebraic number implicitly assumes a dynamical
selection principle that pins the moduli to a specific point. Without
such a principle, the prediction is underdetermined. The observed mH =
125 GeV corresponds to λ ≈ 0 at high scales, which requires R to be
fine-tuned---a fact about dynamics on *M*(K₆), not about K₆ itself.

**6. The Boundary as a Theorem**

We can now state the classification in its sharpest form:

**Classification Theorem.** *Let G be a complete graph K₂ₙ with
decorated Dirac operator D = Σ tᵢΨᵢ and moduli space M(G). The spectral
observables of D partition into exactly three classes:*

> *(i) Graph-topological:* The matching algebra structure Alg({Mᵢ}), its
> representation-theoretic decomposition, and any property determined by
> the decorated graph (G, flux) alone. These are constant on *M*(G).
>
> *(ii) Moduli-topological:* Integer-valued spectral invariants
> including winding numbers, Chern classes, Morse indices of band
> structures, and codimension conditions for band degeneracies. These
> are locally constant on the complement of the discriminant locus Δ ⊂
> *M*(G) and can only change at wall-crossings.
>
> *(iii) Moduli-geometric:* Continuous spectral functions including
> eigenvalue magnitudes, spectral ratios, and all quantities derived
> from them via the spectral action (coupling constants, mass
> parameters). These vary smoothly on *M*(G) and require a dynamical
> theory to determine.

*The classification is exhaustive, and the category of each observable
is determined by its functional dependence on {tᵢ}: constant ⇒ (i),
discrete-valued ⇒ (ii), continuous ⇒ (iii).*

The physical content of this theorem is that it draws a *principled*
boundary between what is structural and what is parametric in the
Standard Model. This boundary is not a modeling choice---it is a
mathematical consequence of the invariance structure of moduli spaces.

**7. Discussion**

**7.1. What This Framework Claims**

The central claim is *not* that the framework predicts all parameters of
the Standard Model. Rather, it claims to identify, with mathematical
precision, which features of particle physics are algebraic necessities
and which are dynamical contingencies. The gauge group, generation
count, chirality, and Higgs multiplicity fall in the first category. The
coupling constants, masses, and mixing angles fall in the second. The
classification explains why the first group is universal across all
plausible vacuum states and the second group requires input beyond
algebra.

**7.2. Relation to Existing Work**

The Chamseddine--Connes--Marcolli framework inputs the algebra AF = ℂ ⊕
ℍ ⊕ M₃(ℂ) and derives the SM Lagrangian. Our approach derives the
algebra from the Diophantine equation and additionally classifies which
derived quantities are robust. The failure of the CCM Higgs mass
prediction (originally \~170 GeV, later corrected) is naturally
explained: the Higgs mass is SILENT and cannot be fixed by algebraic
data alone.

Lisi's E8 theory attempts to embed all fields into a single algebraic
structure. The obstruction identified by Distler and Garibaldi
(impossibility of embedding three chiral generations) corresponds in our
language to a quantity that is FORCED by E8's representation
theory---the model's algebraic structure simply does not accommodate the
required chirality, a graph-topological obstruction.

The string landscape, with its \~10^500^ vacua, is consistent with our
framework if the FORCED quantities (gauge group structure) are common to
a large vacuum class while SILENT quantities (masses, couplings) vary.
This would explain both the landscape's size and the anthropic intuition
that "some things had to be this way."

**7.3. Limitations and Open Problems**

Several important questions remain:

*Dynamics on moduli space.* The framework identifies SILENT quantities
but provides no mechanism to select the physical point in *M*(G). A
dynamical theory---perhaps derived from the spectral action with
appropriate cutoff function---is needed. This is the main open problem.

*K₆ verification.* The computational verification presented here covers
K₄ with V₄ algebra. The analogous computation for K₆ with S₅ matching
algebra and its 15-dimensional moduli space requires substantially more
computation and is deferred to future work.

*REDUCED boundary refinement.* The precise wall-crossing structure of Δ
⊂ *M*(K₄) deserves further study. The chamber structure may encode
discrete physical data (such as the number of massless particles in
different phases) that constrains the physical vacuum.

*Experimental tests.* The most directly testable prediction from the
REDUCED category is the anomalous dimension γ₃ \> 2 at the K₄ critical
point (democratic point), which is accessible to lattice Monte Carlo
computation. The FORCED prediction---that no extension of the Standard
Model changes the gauge group without changing the graph---constrains
BSM model-building.

**8. Conclusion**

We have established a classification theorem for physical observables in
spectral graph geometry, grounded in a precise mathematical criterion:
invariance under deformations of the Dirac operator within its moduli
space. The three categories---graph-topological (FORCED),
moduli-topological (REDUCED), and moduli-geometric (SILENT)---correspond
to distinct invariance groups and yield a sharp boundary between
structural and parametric features of the Standard Model.

The classification has been verified computationally for K₄ and
analytically for key observables. It resolves the ambiguity in spectral
unification programs about which quantities are genuine predictions: the
gauge group, generation count, and chirality are algebraic necessities;
coupling constants and masses are dynamical contingencies; topological
invariants like Chern numbers occupy an intermediate category of
discrete constraints.

The framework's contribution is not a number---it is a theorem about
which questions are well-posed. This distinction between structural and
parametric physics, made mathematically precise through moduli-space
invariance, may prove more valuable than any specific parameter
prediction.
