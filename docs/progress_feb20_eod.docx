**Progress Report: NCG Internal Geometry of K₈**

**Chirality, Gauge Algebra, and the Higgs Inheritance**

Brian Porter

February 20, 2026 (End of Day)

**Executive Summary**

Today was a breakthrough day for the finite internal geometry. Starting
from the question "how do Standard Model gauge couplings emerge from
K₈?", five sessions systematically constructed the noncommutative
geometry (NCG) of the K₈ matching algebra: the real structure J, the
internal chirality γ_F, the Dirac operator D_F, and the gauge algebra.
By the end of the day, three structural discoveries emerged that go
beyond what was previously known.

**Discovery 1: K₆ uniquely selects the K₈ chirality grading.** Of 70
possible balanced vertex splits of K₈, only 6 produce rank-3 Yukawa
(three generations + zero mode). Three independent criteria — K₆
compatibility, minimal Yukawa spread, hub edge universality — converge
uniquely on Pair C: {0,1,2,3} vs {4,5,6,7}. This is the Higgs-active
vs Higgs-passive split.

**Discovery 2: SU(2) intrinsically crosses chirality; SU(3) preserves
it.** The electroweak parity violation of the Standard Model — the fact
that SU(2)_L couples only to left-handed fermions — emerges geometrically
from the K₈ vertex grading. The hub vertex (v=7) lives entirely in the
γ=−1 sector while the trivial Z₇ representation spans both sectors,
making it impossible to construct SU(2) generators that preserve
chirality. SU(3) generators, acting on Z₇ doublets, CAN be made
chirality-preserving. This is the geometric origin of the strong/weak
asymmetry.

**Discovery 3: K₆ Higgs kurtosis is preserved per-chirality in K₈.**
The spectral ratio R = a₄/a₂² = 0.3722 that gives m_H = 126 GeV in the
K₆ paper is independently reproduced in EACH 4-vertex chirality sector
of K₈: R₊₊ = 0.3811 (2.4% match) and R₋₋ = 0.3711 (0.3% match). The
K₆ Higgs prediction passes through the embedding intact.

**What was accomplished:** Full NCG internal geometry of K₈ constructed
(J, γ_F, D_F, gauge algebra). Factor of ½ in gauge coupling traced to
algebraic root. Seeley-DeWitt a₄ computed. K₆/K₈ ratio puzzle resolved.

**What failed:** ±μ eigenvalue pairing as chirality grading (gives zero
Yukawa). Chirality-projected gauge ratios (destroy coupling structure).

**What is open:** sin²θ_W extraction. Continuum limit of chirality
asymmetry. RG flow connecting vertex-space flatness to matching-space
hierarchy.


**1. NCG Real Structure and Doubled Space**

**1.1 The J Operator**

The real structure J acts on the doubled Hilbert space H = ℝ⁸ ⊕ ℝ⁸ via
J(ψ₁, ψ₂) = (ψ₂, ψ₁) (swap). This satisfies:

  J² = +1,  JD = +DJ,  Jγ = −γJ

matching KO-dimension 6 mod 8 — the correct dimension for the SM finite
geometry (Connes 2006). This was verified computationally across all
possible J candidates; the swap operator is the unique solution.

**1.2 The γ_F Disaster and Recovery**

The natural candidate for internal chirality — pairing eigenvalues ±μ of
D_F — produced γ_F that COMMUTES with D_F, giving D₊₋ = 0 (zero Yukawa
block). Root cause: γ_F constructed from D_F's own eigenbasis necessarily
commutes with D_F.

Recovery: scan all 70 balanced 4+4 vertex splits for γ_F candidates.

**Status: KILLED** (±μ pairing as chirality grading)


**2. Vertex-Based Chirality: The Pair C Selection**

**2.1 The Scan**

Of 70 balanced (4+4) vertex splits:
- 64 (91.4%) give rank-4 Yukawa (no zero mode — not physical)
- 6 (8.6%) give rank-3 Yukawa (three generations + zero mode)

The 6 rank-3 splits form 3 complementary pairs, ALL containing the hub
edge {0,1} in the same chirality sector:

  Pair A: {0,1,5,6}/{2,3,4,7}  —  SVs [1.316, 1.211, 0.528]  —  34.3% spread
  Pair B: {0,1,4,7}/{2,3,5,6}  —  SVs [1.136, 1.000, 0.642]  —  22.5% spread
  Pair C: {0,1,2,3}/{4,5,6,7}  —  SVs [0.938, 0.766, 0.744]  —  10.6% spread

**2.2 Three Criteria Converge on Pair C**

(1) K₆ compatibility: {0,1,2,3} = K₄ Higgs-active core (vertices 0,1
are the hub edge; 2,3 complete the K₄ that K₆ selects). {4,5,6,7} =
spectators + external = Higgs-passive. Only Pair C has this structure.

(2) Minimal Yukawa spread: 10.6% (3× smaller than Pair A). Close to
SU(3) flavor degeneracy, consistent with the near-degenerate generation
structure that RG flow subsequently splits.

(3) Hub edge universality: All 28 possible hub edges produce the same
Pair C pattern (tested exhaustively). The selection is independent of
which edge serves as the hub.

**2.3 Vertex Democracy**

(D²_F)_vv = 1.1559 uniformly for all 8 vertices. Despite the hub edge
dominating the matching space and D_F[0,1] = 0 exactly, every vertex
carries the same "mass weight." This is a non-trivial structural
property of the K₈ matching algebra.

**Status: CONFIRMED** — Pair C uniquely selected by three independent criteria


**3. Gauge Algebra and Chirality Violation**

**3.1 Generator Construction**

SU(3): 8 Gell-Mann generators from Z₇ doublet rotations (d₁↔d₂,
d₁↔d₃, d₂↔d₃, diagonal), acting on the 3D color subspace in each
chirality sector.

SU(2): 3 Pauli generators from triv↔hub rotations in the singlet
sector.

U(1)_Y: Hypercharge Y = (1/3)P_color + (−1)P_singlet.

**3.2 The Chirality Asymmetry**

                      Chirality behavior     Physical meaning
  SU(3) color         Preserves γ_F          Confining, vector-like
  SU(2) weak          Violates γ_F           Chiral, parity-violating

Root cause: Hub vertex (v=7) lives entirely in V₋ = {4,5,6,7}. The
trivial Z₇ rep spans BOTH V₊ and V₋ (0.571 dimensions in V₊, 0.429 in
V₋). Therefore the SU(2) generators τ = |triv⟩⟨hub| + h.c. necessarily
map V₊ ↔ V₋. No SU(2) generator can be chirality-preserving.

This is the geometric origin of electroweak parity violation: SU(2)_L
distinguishes chiralities because the singlet sector straddles the
vertex grading boundary. The W boson's inner fluctuation [D_F, τ_a] IS
the chirality-violating connection.

**3.3 Gauge Coupling Traces**

Unprojected (full traces, no chirality enforcement):
  a₃ = 22.595  (SU(3), 8 generators)
  a₂ = 7.926   (SU(2), 3 generators)
  a₁ = 4.697   (U(1), 1 generator)
  a₂/a₃ = 0.351

SVD-basis chirality-preserving SU(3):
  a₃(SVD) = 4.170
  Casimir check: a₃/(C₂ × Tr(P_color·D²)) = 0.502 ≈ 1/2

**Status: CONFIRMED** — SU(2) chirality violation emerges from vertex geometry


**4. The Factor of ½: Algebraic Root**

**4.1 The Puzzle**

The SU(3) spectral action coefficient a₃(SVD) = 4.170 is exactly half
the Casimir prediction C₂(fund) × Tr(P_color·D²) = 8.310. Where does
the ½ come from?

**4.2 The Answer: Off-Diagonal Casimir + Block Decomposition**

The Yukawa block D₊₋ = diag(σ₁, σ₂, σ₃) in the SVD basis contributes:

  Σ_a ||[D₊₋, T_a]||² = ½ × Σ_{i≠j} (σᵢ − σⱼ)²

The ½ is the off-diagonal SU(3) Casimir coefficient: Σ_a |T^a_ij|² = ½
for i ≠ j in the fundamental representation. Standard representation
theory, not mysterious.

But the full block decomposition reveals the deeper story:

  V₊ color↔color:      0.890  (21.3%)
  V₋ color↔color:      1.138  (27.3%)
  Color↔lepton mixing:  2.008  (48.1%)    ← DOMINANT
  Yukawa (cross-chiral): 0.135  (3.2%)

48% of the gauge coupling comes from color-lepton mixing, because the
SVD "color" directions are not pure Z₇ doublets (u₃ has 42% singlet
content). The apparent ½ factor is the redistribution of spectral weight
across the color-lepton boundary.

**4.3 Key Insight: Gauge Coupling Measures Variance**

When all Yukawa eigenvalues are equal: [diag(σ,σ,σ), T_a] = 0 for all
generators. The Yukawa contribution to a₃ is proportional to the
VARIANCE of the spectrum, not its magnitude. Our 10.6% Yukawa spread →
only 3.2% of total a₃ comes from the Yukawa sector.

**Status: CONFIRMED** — ½ traced to standard Casimir identity


**5. Seeley-DeWitt a₄ Coefficient**

**5.1 Raw Numbers**

                    Single copy (ℝ⁸)     Doubled (ℝ¹⁶)
  a₀ = Tr(I)       8                    16
  a₂ = Tr(D²)      9.247                18.495
  a₄ = Tr(D⁴)      16.081               32.161
  a₄/a₂            1.739                1.739
  a₄/a₂²           0.188                0.094

**5.2 Z₇ Sector Decomposition**

  Sector    a₂       a₄       a₄/a₂
  d₁        2.677    4.912    1.835
  d₂        2.649    4.569    1.725
  d₃        2.600    4.239    1.630
  triv      0.165    0.295    1.787
  hub       1.156    2.066    1.787

Notable: triv and hub have IDENTICAL a₄/a₂ = 1.787. The singlet sector
is spectrally uniform despite completely different spatial distributions
(triv = distributed across all vertices, hub = localized on v=7).

**5.3 Yukawa Content**

  Σσ² = 2.019  (21.8% of a₂)  — Higgs mass parameter
  Σσ⁴ = 1.423  (8.8% of a₄)   — Higgs quartic
  (Σσ²)²/Σσ⁴ = 2.864          — flatness ratio (3 = degenerate, 1 = hierarchical)
  D_ll_pm = 0.000 exactly      — lepton completely decoupled from Higgs

**Status: COMPUTED** — Full a₂, a₄ available for spectral action predictions


**6. K₆/K₈ Ratio: Resolution**

**6.1 The Puzzle**

K₆ paper: a₄/a₂² = 0.3722 → m_H = 126 GeV
K₈ Yukawa: Σσ⁴/Σσ² = 0.705 → appeared to be ~2× K₆

**6.2 The Resolution**

The apparent factor of 2 arose from comparing INCOMMENSURABLE quantities:
different spaces (matching vs vertex), different phase content (Z₃ vs
none), different sector restrictions (full vs Yukawa-only).

The correct comparison — Yukawa kurtosis R = Σσ⁴/(Σσ²)² — gives:

  K₆ R = 0.3722
  K₈ Yukawa R = 0.3491
  Ratio = 0.938  (6% below K₆, NOT 2× above)

**6.3 The Per-Chirality Match**

                        Tr(D²)        Tr(D⁴)        R = Tr(D⁴)/Tr(D²)²     R/R_K₆
  γ=+1 ({0,1,2,3})     4.624 (50.0%) 8.147 (50.7%)  0.3811                 1.024
  γ=−1 ({4,5,6,7})     4.624 (50.0%) 7.933 (49.3%)  0.3711                 0.997
  K₆ reference          —             —               0.3722                 1.000

R₋₋ = 0.3711 matches R_K₆ = 0.3722 to 0.3%.

Each 4-vertex chirality sector independently reproduces the K₆ Higgs
kurtosis. The K₆ prediction is not doubled — it is REPLICATED in each
chirality block. The m_H = 126 GeV prediction passes through intact.

**Status: KILLED** (factor of 2 — was an apples-to-oranges comparison)
**Status: CONFIRMED** (K₆ Higgs kurtosis preserved per-chirality)


**7. Ledger**

**Confirmed today:**
- KO-dimension 6 from J = swap on ℝ⁸ ⊕ ℝ⁸
- Pair C uniquely selected by K₆ compatibility, minimal spread, hub universality
- Vertex democracy: (D²_F)_vv = 1.1559 uniform for all 8 vertices
- SU(3) preserves Pair C chirality; SU(2) violates it (geometric parity violation)
- ½ factor = off-diagonal SU(3) Casimir coefficient
- 48% of a₃ from color-lepton mixing (SVD color ≠ pure Z₇ doublet)
- a₃(Yukawa) ∝ variance of {σᵢ}, vanishes for degenerate spectrum
- triv and hub sectors have identical a₄/a₂ = 1.787
- K₆ kurtosis R = 0.372 preserved independently in each K₈ chirality sector
- D_ll_pm = 0 (lepton decoupled from Higgs mechanism)

**Killed today:**
- ±μ eigenvalue pairing as chirality grading (gives D₊₋ = 0)
- Chirality-projected gauge ratios (destroys coupling structure)
- "Factor of 2" between K₆ and K₈ Higgs ratios (was apples-to-oranges)

**Open:**
- sin²θ_W: need proper extraction accounting for SU(2) chirality violation
- Continuum limit: does chirality asymmetry (SU(2) violating, SU(3) preserving) persist at K₁₀, K₁₂?
- RG flow connecting vertex-space flatness (r = 2.97) to matching-space hierarchy (415:135:1)
- Color-lepton mixing: 48% of a₃ comes from color-lepton boundary — physical meaning?
- SU(2) generator normalization in the chirality-violating sector
- Full spectral action: connecting vertex-space a₂, a₄ to matching-space coefficients with Z₃ phases


**8. Priority Queue (Next Steps)**

(a) sin²θ_W extraction — The SU(2) chirality violation means the
standard trace formula needs modification. The correct computation
should use the chirality-violating SU(2) generators and
chirality-preserving SU(3) generators in a MIXED framework. This is the
most immediate target.

(b) Continuum limit test — Check whether the SU(3)-preserves / SU(2)-violates
pattern survives at K₁₀ and K₁₂. If it does, it's a structural feature
of the framework. If it doesn't, it's a finite-K₈ artifact.

(c) Full spectral action with Z₃ phases — Today's a₄ computation used
vertex-space Tr(D⁴) without Z₃ momentum conservation. The matching-space
quartic form H(v,v,v,v) with Z₃ phases is the physically correct
quantity. Computing this consistently across K₆ → K₈ should unify the
gauge and Higgs sectors.

(d) Seeley-DeWitt a₄ coefficient for gauge normalization — The a₄
coefficient contains both the Higgs quartic AND gauge kinetic terms. A
clean decomposition separating these would determine the normalization
constant c that converts R = 0.3722 into m_H = 126 GeV.
